You will build a small tic-tac-toe game during this tutorial. This tutorial does not assume any existing React knowledge. The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any React app, and fully understanding it will give you a deep understanding of React.
This tutorial is designed for people who prefer to learn by doing and want to quickly try making something tangible. If you prefer learning each concept step by step, start with Describing the UI.
The tutorial is divided into several sections:
Setup for the tutorial will give you a starting point to follow the tutorial.
Overview will teach you the fundamentals of React: components, props, and state.
Completing the game will teach you the most common techniques in React development.
Adding time travel will give you a deeper insight into the unique strengths of React.
In this tutorial, you’ll build an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.
You can see what it will look like when you’re finished here:
If the code doesn’t make sense to you yet, or if you are unfamiliar with the code’s syntax, don’t worry! The goal of this tutorial is to help you understand React and its syntax.
We recommend that you check out the tic-tac-toe game above before continuing with the tutorial. One of the features that you’ll notice is that there is a numbered list to the right of the game’s board. This list gives you a history of all of the moves that have occurred in the game, and it is updated as the game progresses.
Once you’ve played around with the finished tic-tac-toe game, keep scrolling. You’ll start with a simpler template in this tutorial. Our next step is to set you up so that you can start building the game.
In the live code editor below, click Fork in the top-right corner to open the editor in a new tab using the website CodeSandbox. CodeSandbox lets you write code in your browser and preview how your users will see the app you’ve created. The new tab should display an empty square and the starter code for this tutorial.
You can also follow this tutorial using your local development environment. To do this, you need to:
Install Node.js
In the CodeSandbox tab you opened earlier, press the top-left corner button to open the menu, and then choose Download Sandbox in that menu to download an archive of the files locally
Unzip the archive, then open a terminal and cd to the directory you unzipped
Install the dependencies with npm install
Run npm start to start a local server and follow the prompts to view the code running in a browser
If you get stuck, don’t let this stop you! Follow along online instead and try a local setup again later.
Now that you’re set up, let’s get an overview of React!
In CodeSandbox you’ll see three main sections:
The Files section with a list of files like App.js, index.js, styles.css and a folder called public
The code editor where you’ll see the source code of your selected file
The browser section where you’ll see how the code you’ve written will be displayed
The App.js file should be selected in the Files section. The contents of that file in the code editor should be:
The browser section should be displaying a square with a X in it like this:
Now let’s have a look at the files in the starter code.
The code in App.js creates a component. In React, a component is a piece of reusable code that represents a part of a user interface. Components are used to render, manage, and update the UI elements in your application. Let’s look at the component line by line to see what’s going on:
The first line defines a function called Square. The export JavaScript keyword makes this function accessible outside of this file. The default keyword tells other files using your code that it’s the main function in your file.
The second line returns a button. The return JavaScript keyword means whatever comes after is returned as a value to the caller of the function. <button> is a JSX element. A JSX element is a combination of JavaScript code and HTML tags that describes what you’d like to display. className=""square"" is a button property or prop that tells CSS how to style the button. X is the text displayed inside of the button and </button> closes the JSX element to indicate that any following content shouldn’t be placed inside the button.
Click on the file labeled styles.css in the Files section of CodeSandbox. This file defines the styles for your React app. The first two CSS selectors (* and body) define the style of large parts of your app while the .square selector defines the style of any component where the className property is set to square. In your code, that would match the button from your Square component in the App.js file.
Click on the file labeled index.js in the Files section of CodeSandbox. You won’t be editing this file during the tutorial but it is the bridge between the component you created in the App.js file and the web browser.
Lines 1-5 bring all the necessary pieces together:
React
React’s library to talk to web browsers (React DOM)
the styles for your components
the component you created in App.js.
The remainder of the file brings all the pieces together and injects the final product into index.html in the public folder.
Let’s get back to App.js. This is where you’ll spend the rest of the tutorial.
Currently the board is only a single square, but you need nine! If you just try and copy paste your square to make two squares like this:
You’ll get this error:
React components need to return a single JSX element and not multiple adjacent JSX elements like two buttons. To fix this you can use Fragments (<> and </>) to wrap multiple adjacent JSX elements like this:
Now you should see:
Great! Now you just need to copy-paste a few times to add nine squares and…
Oh no! The squares are all in a single line, not in a grid like you need for our board. To fix this you’ll need to group your squares into rows with divs and add some CSS classes. While you’re at it, you’ll give each square a number to make sure you know where each square is displayed.
In the App.js file, update the Square component to look like this:
The CSS defined in styles.css styles the divs with the className of board-row. Now that you’ve grouped your components into rows with the styled divs you have your tic-tac-toe board:
But you now have a problem. Your component named Square, really isn’t a square anymore. Let’s fix that by changing the name to Board:
At this point your code should look something like this:
Psssst… That’s a lot to type! It’s okay to copy and paste code from this page. However, if you’re up for a little challenge, we recommend only copying code that you’ve manually typed at least once yourself.
Next, you’ll want to change the value of a square from empty to “X” when the user clicks on the square. With how you’ve built the board so far you would need to copy-paste the code that updates the square nine times (once for each square you have)! Instead of copy-pasting, React’s component architecture allows you to create a reusable component to avoid messy, duplicated code.
First, you are going to copy the line defining your first square (<button className=""square"">1</button>) from your Board component into a new Square component:
Then you’ll update the Board component to render that Square component using JSX syntax:
Note how unlike the browser divs, your own components Board and Square must start with a capital letter.
Let’s take a look:
Oh no! You lost the numbered squares you had before. Now each square says “1”. To fix this, you will use props to pass the value each square should have from the parent component (Board) to its child (Square).
Update the Square component to read the value prop that you’ll pass from the Board:
function Square({ value }) indicates the Square component can be passed a prop called value.
Now you want to display that value instead of 1 inside every square. Try doing it like this:
Oops, this is not what you wanted:
You wanted to render the JavaScript variable called value from your component, not the word “value”. To “escape into JavaScript” from JSX, you need curly braces. Add curly braces around value in JSX like so:
For now, you should see an empty board:
This is because the Board component hasn’t passed the value prop to each Square component it renders yet. To fix it you’ll add the value prop to each Square component rendered by the Board component:
Now you should see a grid of numbers again:
Your updated code should look like this:
Let’s fill the Square component with an X when you click it. Declare a function called handleClick inside of the Square. Then, add onClick to the props of the button JSX element returned from the Square:
If you click on a square now, you should see a log saying ""clicked!"" in the Console tab at the bottom of the Browser section in CodeSandbox. Clicking the square more than once will log ""clicked!"" again. Repeated console logs with the same message will not create more lines in the console. Instead, you will see an incrementing counter next to your first ""clicked!"" log.
If you are following this tutorial using your local development environment, you need to open your browser’s Console. For example, if you use the Chrome browser, you can view the Console with the keyboard shortcut Shift + Ctrl + J (on Windows/Linux) or Option + ⌘ + J (on macOS).
As a next step, you want the Square component to “remember” that it got clicked, and fill it with an “X” mark. To “remember” things, components use state.
React provides a special function called useState that you can call from your component to let it “remember” things. Let’s store the current value of the Square in state, and change it when the Square is clicked.
Import useState at the top of the file. Remove the value prop from the Square component. Instead, add a new line at the start of the Square that calls useState. Have it return a state variable called value:
value stores the value and setValue is a function that can be used to change the value. The null passed to useState is used as the initial value for this state variable, so value here starts off equal to null.
Since the Square component no longer accepts props anymore, you’ll remove the value prop from all nine of the Square components created by the Board component:
Now you’ll change Square to display an “X” when clicked. Replace the console.log(""clicked!""); event handler with setValue('X');. Now your Square component looks like this:
By calling this set function from an onClick handler, you’re telling React to re-render that Square whenever its <button> is clicked. After the update, the Square’s value will be 'X', so you’ll see the “X” on the game board. Click on any Square, and “X” should show up:
Each Square has its own state: the value stored in each Square is completely independent of the others. When you call a set function in a component, React automatically updates the child components inside too.
After you’ve made the above changes, your code will look like this:
React DevTools let you check the props and the state of your React components. You can find the React DevTools tab at the bottom of the browser section in CodeSandbox:
To inspect a particular component on the screen, use the button in the top left corner of React DevTools:
For local development, React DevTools is available as a Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browser extension. Install it, and the Components tab will appear in your browser Developer Tools for sites using React.
By this point, you have all the basic building blocks for your tic-tac-toe game. To have a complete game, you now need to alternate placing “X”s and “O”s on the board, and you need a way to determine a winner.
Currently, each Square component maintains a part of the game’s state. To check for a winner in a tic-tac-toe game, the Board would need to somehow know the state of each of the 9 Square components.
How would you approach that? At first, you might guess that the Board needs to “ask” each Square for that Square’s state. Although this approach is technically possible in React, we discourage it because the code becomes difficult to understand, susceptible to bugs, and hard to refactor. Instead, the best approach is to store the game’s state in the parent Board component instead of in each Square. The Board component can tell each Square what to display by passing a prop, like you did when you passed a number to each Square.
To collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components communicate with each other, declare the shared state in their parent component instead. The parent component can pass that state back down to the children via props. This keeps the child components in sync with each other and with their parent.
Lifting state into a parent component is common when React components are refactored.
Let’s take this opportunity to try it out. Edit the Board component so that it declares a state variable named squares that defaults to an array of 9 nulls corresponding to the 9 squares:
Array(9).fill(null) creates an array with nine elements and sets each of them to null. The useState() call around it declares a squares state variable that’s initially set to that array. Each entry in the array corresponds to the value of a square. When you fill the board in later, the squares array will look like this:
Now your Board component needs to pass the value prop down to each Square that it renders:
Next, you’ll edit the Square component to receive the value prop from the Board component. This will require removing the Square component’s own stateful tracking of value and the button’s onClick prop:
At this point you should see an empty tic-tac-toe board:
And your code should look like this:
Each Square will now receive a value prop that will either be 'X', 'O', or null for empty squares.
Next, you need to change what happens when a Square is clicked. The Board component now maintains which squares are filled. You’ll need to create a way for the Square to update the Board’s state. Since state is private to a component that defines it, you cannot update the Board’s state directly from Square.
Instead, you’ll pass down a function from the Board component to the Square component, and you’ll have Square call that function when a square is clicked. You’ll start with the function that the Square component will call when it is clicked. You’ll call that function onSquareClick:
Next, you’ll add the onSquareClick function to the Square component’s props:
Now you’ll connect the onSquareClick prop to a function in the Board component that you’ll name handleClick. To connect onSquareClick to handleClick you’ll pass a function to the onSquareClick prop of the first Square component:
Lastly, you will define the handleClick function inside the Board component to update the squares array holding your board’s state:
The handleClick function creates a copy of the squares array (nextSquares) with the JavaScript slice() Array method. Then, handleClick updates the nextSquares array to add X to the first ([0] index) square.
Calling the setSquares function lets React know the state of the component has changed. This will trigger a re-render of the components that use the squares state (Board) as well as its child components (the Square components that make up the board).
JavaScript supports closures which means an inner function (e.g. handleClick) has access to variables and functions defined in an outer function (e.g. Board). The handleClick function can read the squares state and call the setSquares method because they are both defined inside of the Board function.
Now you can add X’s to the board…  but only to the upper left square. Your handleClick function is hardcoded to update the index for the upper left square (0). Let’s update handleClick to be able to update any square. Add an argument i to the handleClick function that takes the index of the square to update:
Next, you will need to pass that i to handleClick. You could try to set the onSquareClick prop of square to be handleClick(0) directly in the JSX like this, but it won’t work:
Here is why this doesn’t work. The handleClick(0) call will be a part of rendering the board component. Because handleClick(0) alters the state of the board component by calling setSquares, your entire board component will be re-rendered again. But this runs handleClick(0) again, leading to an infinite loop:
Why didn’t this problem happen earlier?
When you were passing onSquareClick={handleClick}, you were passing the handleClick function down as a prop. You were not calling it! But now you are calling that function right away—notice the parentheses in handleClick(0)—and that’s why it runs too early. You don’t want to call handleClick until the user clicks!
You could fix this by creating a function like handleFirstSquareClick that calls handleClick(0), a function like handleSecondSquareClick that calls handleClick(1), and so on. You would pass (rather than call) these functions down as props like onSquareClick={handleFirstSquareClick}. This would solve the infinite loop.
However, defining nine different functions and giving each of them a name is too verbose. Instead, let’s do this:
Notice the new () => syntax. Here, () => handleClick(0) is an arrow function, which is a shorter way to define functions. When the square is clicked, the code after the => “arrow” will run, calling handleClick(0).
Now you need to update the other eight squares to call handleClick from the arrow functions you pass. Make sure that the argument for each call of the handleClick corresponds to the index of the correct square:
Now you can again add X’s to any square on the board by clicking on them:
But this time all the state management is handled by the Board component!
This is what your code should look like:
Now that your state handling is in the Board component, the parent Board component passes props to the child Square components so that they can be displayed correctly. When clicking on a Square, the child Square component now asks the parent Board component to update the state of the board. When the Board’s state changes, both the Board component and every child Square re-renders automatically. Keeping the state of all squares in the Board component will allow it to determine the winner in the future.
Let’s recap what happens when a user clicks the top left square on your board to add an X to it:
Clicking on the upper left square runs the function that the button received as its onClick prop from the Square. The Square component received that function as its onSquareClick prop from the Board. The Board component defined that function directly in the JSX. It calls handleClick with an argument of 0.
handleClick uses the argument (0) to update the first element of the squares array from null to X.
The squares state of the Board component was updated, so the Board and all of its children re-render. This causes the value prop of the Square component with index 0 to change from null to X.
In the end the user sees that the upper left square has changed from empty to having a X after clicking it.
The DOM <button> element’s onClick attribute has a special meaning to React because it is a built-in component. For custom components like Square, the naming is up to you. You could give any name to the Square’s onSquareClick prop or Board’s handleClick function, and the code would work the same. In React, it’s conventional to use onSomething names for props which represent events and handleSomething for the function definitions which handle those events.
Note how in handleClick, you call .slice() to create a copy of the squares array instead of modifying the existing array. To explain why, we need to discuss immutability and why immutability is important to learn.
There are generally two approaches to changing data. The first approach is to mutate the data by directly changing the data’s values. The second approach is to replace the data with a new copy which has the desired changes. Here is what it would look like if you mutated the squares array:
And here is what it would look like if you changed data without mutating the squares array:
The result is the same but by not mutating (changing the underlying data) directly, you gain several benefits.
Immutability makes complex features much easier to implement. Later in this tutorial, you will implement a “time travel” feature that lets you review the game’s history and “jump back” to past moves. This functionality isn’t specific to games—an ability to undo and redo certain actions is a common requirement for apps. Avoiding direct data mutation lets you keep previous versions of the data intact, and reuse them later.
There is also another benefit of immutability. By default, all child components re-render automatically when the state of a parent component changes. This includes even the child components that weren’t affected by the change. Although re-rendering is not by itself noticeable to the user (you shouldn’t actively try to avoid it!), you might want to skip re-rendering a part of the tree that clearly wasn’t affected by it for performance reasons. Immutability makes it very cheap for components to compare whether their data has changed or not. You can learn more about how React chooses when to re-render a component in the memo API reference.
It’s now time to fix a major defect in this tic-tac-toe game: the “O”s cannot be marked on the board.
You’ll set the first move to be “X” by default. Let’s keep track of this by adding another piece of state to the Board component:
Each time a player moves, xIsNext (a boolean) will be flipped to determine which player goes next and the game’s state will be saved. You’ll update the Board’s handleClick function to flip the value of xIsNext:
Now, as you click on different squares, they will alternate between X and O, as they should!
But wait, there’s a problem. Try clicking on the same square multiple times:
The X is overwritten by an O! While this would add a very interesting twist to the game, we’re going to stick to the original rules for now.
When you mark a square with a X or an O you aren’t first checking to see if the square already has a X or O value. You can fix this by returning early. You’ll check to see if the square already has a X or an O. If the square is already filled, you will return in the handleClick function early—before it tries to update the board state.
Now you can only add X’s or O’s to empty squares! Here is what your code should look like at this point:
Now that the players can take turns, you’ll want to show when the game is won and there are no more turns to make. To do this you’ll add a helper function called calculateWinner that takes an array of 9 squares, checks for a winner and returns 'X', 'O', or null as appropriate. Don’t worry too much about the calculateWinner function; it’s not specific to React:
It does not matter whether you define calculateWinner before or after the Board. Let’s put it at the end so that you don’t have to scroll past it every time you edit your components.
You will call calculateWinner(squares) in the Board component’s handleClick function to check if a player has won. You can perform this check at the same time you check if a user has clicked a square that already has a X or and O. We’d like to return early in both cases:
To let the players know when the game is over, you can display text such as “Winner: X” or “Winner: O”. To do that you’ll add a status section to the Board component. The status will display the winner if the game is over and if the game is ongoing you’ll display which player’s turn is next:
Congratulations! You now have a working tic-tac-toe game. And you’ve just learned the basics of React too. So you are the real winner here. Here is what the code should look like:
As a final exercise, let’s make it possible to “go back in time” to the previous moves in the game.
If you mutated the squares array, implementing time travel would be very difficult.
However, you used slice() to create a new copy of the squares array after every move, and treated it as immutable. This will allow you to store every past version of the squares array, and navigate between the turns that have already happened.
You’ll store the past squares arrays in another array called history, which you’ll store as a new state variable. The history array represents all board states, from the first to the last move, and has a shape like this:
You will now write a new top-level component called Game to display a list of past moves. That’s where you will place the history state that contains the entire game history.
Placing the history state into the Game component will let you remove the squares state from its child Board component. Just like you “lifted state up” from the Square component into the Board component, you will now lift it up from the Board into the top-level Game component. This gives the Game component full control over the Board’s data and lets it instruct the Board to render previous turns from the history.
First, add a Game component with export default. Have it render the Board component and some markup:
Note that you are removing the export default keywords before the function Board() { declaration and adding them before the function Game() { declaration. This tells your index.js file to use the Game component as the top-level component instead of your Board component. The additional divs returned by the Game component are making room for the game information you’ll add to the board later.
Add some state to the Game component to track which player is next and the history of moves:
Notice how [Array(9).fill(null)] is an array with a single item, which itself is an array of 9 nulls.
To render the squares for the current move, you’ll want to read the last squares array from the history. You don’t need useState for this—you already have enough information to calculate it during rendering:
Next, create a handlePlay function inside the Game component that will be called by the Board component to update the game. Pass xIsNext, currentSquares and handlePlay as props to the Board component:
Let’s make the Board component fully controlled by the props it receives. Change the Board component to take three props: xIsNext, squares, and a new onPlay function that Board can call with the updated squares array when a player makes a move. Next, remove the first two lines of the Board function that call useState:
Now replace the setSquares and setXIsNext calls in handleClick in the Board component with a single call to your new onPlay function so the Game component can update the Board when the user clicks a square:
The Board component is fully controlled by the props passed to it by the Game component. You need to implement the handlePlay function in the Game component to get the game working again.
What should handlePlay do when called? Remember that Board used to call setSquares with an updated array; now it passes the updated squares array to onPlay.
The handlePlay function needs to update Game’s state to trigger a re-render, but you don’t have a setSquares function that you can call any more—you’re now using the history state variable to store this information. You’ll want to update history by appending the updated squares array as a new history entry. You also want to toggle xIsNext, just as Board used to do:
Here, [...history, nextSquares] creates a new array that contains all the items in history, followed by nextSquares. (You can read the ...history spread syntax as “enumerate all the items in history”.)
For example, if history is [[null,null,null], [""X"",null,null]] and nextSquares is [""X"",null,""O""], then the new [...history, nextSquares] array will be [[null,null,null], [""X"",null,null], [""X"",null,""O""]].
At this point, you’ve moved the state to live in the Game component, and the UI should be fully working, just as it was before the refactor. Here is what the code should look like at this point:
Since you are recording the tic-tac-toe game’s history, you can now display a list of past moves to the player.
React elements like <button> are regular JavaScript objects; you can pass them around in your application. To render multiple items in React, you can use an array of React elements.
You already have an array of history moves in state, so now you need to transform it to an array of React elements. In JavaScript, to transform one array into another, you can use the array map method:
You’ll use map to transform your history of moves into React elements representing buttons on the screen, and display a list of buttons to “jump” to past moves. Let’s map over the history in the Game component:
You can see what your code should look like below. Note that you should see an error in the developer tools console that says:
You’ll fix this error in the next section.
As you iterate through history array inside the function you passed to map, the squares argument goes through each element of history, and the move argument goes through each array index: 0, 1, 2, …. (In most cases, you’d need the actual array elements, but to render a list of moves you will only need indexes.)
For each move in the tic-tac-toe game’s history, you create a list item <li> which contains a button <button>. The button has an onClick handler which calls a function called jumpTo (that you haven’t implemented yet).
For now, you should see a list of the moves that occurred in the game and an error in the developer tools console. Let’s discuss what the “key” error means.
When you render a list, React stores some information about each rendered list item. When you update a list, React needs to determine what has changed. You could have added, removed, re-arranged, or updated the list’s items.
Imagine transitioning from
to
In addition to the updated counts, a human reading this would probably say that you swapped Alexa and Ben’s ordering and inserted Claudia between Alexa and Ben. However, React is a computer program and does not know what you intended, so you need to specify a key property for each list item to differentiate each list item from its siblings. If your data was from a database, Alexa, Ben, and Claudia’s database IDs could be used as keys.
When a list is re-rendered, React takes each list item’s key and searches the previous list’s items for a matching key. If the current list has a key that didn’t exist before, React creates a component. If the current list is missing a key that existed in the previous list, React destroys the previous component. If two keys match, the corresponding component is moved.
Keys tell React about the identity of each component, which allows React to maintain state between re-renders. If a component’s key changes, the component will be destroyed and re-created with a new state.
key is a special and reserved property in React. When an element is created, React extracts the key property and stores the key directly on the returned element. Even though key may look like it is passed as props, React automatically uses key to decide which components to update. There’s no way for a component to ask what key its parent specified.
It’s strongly recommended that you assign proper keys whenever you build dynamic lists. If you don’t have an appropriate key, you may want to consider restructuring your data so that you do.
If no key is specified, React will report an error and use the array index as a key by default. Using the array index as a key is problematic when trying to re-order a list’s items or inserting/removing list items. Explicitly passing key={i} silences the error but has the same problems as array indices and is not recommended in most cases.
Keys do not need to be globally unique; they only need to be unique between components and their siblings.
In the tic-tac-toe game’s history, each past move has a unique ID associated with it: it’s the sequential number of the move. Moves will never be re-ordered, deleted, or inserted in the middle, so it’s safe to use the move index as a key.
In the Game function, you can add the key as <li key={move}>, and if you reload the rendered game, React’s “key” error should disappear:
Before you can implement jumpTo, you need the Game component to keep track of which step the user is currently viewing. To do this, define a new state variable called currentMove, defaulting to 0:
Next, update the jumpTo function inside Game to update that currentMove. You’ll also set xIsNext to true if the number that you’re changing currentMove to is even.
You will now make two changes to the Game’s handlePlay function which is called when you click on a square.
If you “go back in time” and then make a new move from that point, you only want to keep the history up to that point. Instead of adding nextSquares after all items (... spread syntax) in history, you’ll add it after all items in history.slice(0, currentMove + 1) so that you’re only keeping that portion of the old history.
Each time a move is made, you need to update currentMove to point to the latest history entry.
Finally, you will modify the Game component to render the currently selected move, instead of always rendering the final move:
If you click on any step in the game’s history, the tic-tac-toe board should immediately update to show what the board looked like after that step occurred.
If you look at the code very closely, you may notice that xIsNext === true when currentMove is even and xIsNext === false when currentMove is odd. In other words, if you know the value of currentMove, then you can always figure out what xIsNext should be.
There’s no reason for you to store both of these in state. In fact, always try to avoid redundant state. Simplifying what you store in state reduces bugs and makes your code easier to understand. Change Game so that it doesn’t store xIsNext as a separate state variable and instead figures it out based on the currentMove:
You no longer need the xIsNext state declaration or the calls to setXIsNext. Now, there’s no chance for xIsNext to get out of sync with currentMove, even if you make a mistake while coding the components.
Congratulations! You’ve created a tic-tac-toe game that:
Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
Indicates when a player has won the game,
Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.
Nice work! We hope you now feel like you have a decent grasp of how React works.
Check out the final result here:
If you have extra time or want to practice your new React skills, here are some ideas for improvements that you could make to the tic-tac-toe game, listed in order of increasing difficulty:
For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
Throughout this tutorial, you’ve touched on React concepts including elements, components, props, and state. Now that you’ve seen how these concepts work when building a game, check out Thinking in React to see how the same React concepts work when building an app’s UI.

# Where to go from here

React can change how you think about the designs you look at and the apps you build. When you build a user interface with React, you will first break it apart into pieces called components. Then, you will describe the different visual states for each of your components. Finally, you will connect your components together so that the data flows through them. In this tutorial, we’ll guide you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table with React.
Imagine that you already have a JSON API and a mockup from a designer.
The JSON API returns some data that looks like this:
The mockup looks like this:
To implement a UI in React, you will usually follow the same five steps.
Start by drawing boxes around every component and subcomponent in the mockup and naming them. If you work with a designer, they may have already named these components in their design tool. Ask them!
Depending on your background, you can think about splitting up a design into components in different ways:
Programming—use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the single responsibility principle, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.
CSS—consider what you would make class selectors for. (However, components are a bit less granular.)
Design—consider how you would organize the design’s layers.
If your JSON is well-structured, you’ll often find that it naturally maps to the component structure of your UI. That’s because UI and data models often have the same information architecture—that is, the same shape. Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model.
There are five components on this screen:
FilterableProductTable (grey) contains the entire app.
SearchBar (blue) receives the user input.
ProductTable (lavender) displays and filters the list according to the user input.
ProductCategoryRow (green) displays a heading for each category.
ProductRow (yellow) displays a row for each product.
If you look at ProductTable (lavender), you’ll see that the table header (containing the “Name” and “Price” labels) isn’t its own component. This is a matter of preference, and you could go either way. For this example, it is a part of ProductTable because it appears inside the ProductTable’s list. However, if this header grows to be complex (e.g., if you add sorting), you can move it into its own ProductTableHeader component.
Now that you’ve identified the components in the mockup, arrange them into a hierarchy. Components that appear within another component in the mockup should appear as a child in the hierarchy:
FilterableProductTable
SearchBar
ProductTable
ProductCategoryRow
ProductRow
SearchBar
ProductTable
ProductCategoryRow
ProductRow
ProductCategoryRow
ProductRow
Now that you have your component hierarchy, it’s time to implement your app. The most straightforward approach is to build a version that renders the UI from your data model without adding any interactivity… yet! It’s often easier to build the static version first and add interactivity later. Building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, but adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing.
To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props. Props are a way of passing data from parent to child. (If you’re familiar with the concept of state, don’t use state at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it.)
You can either build “top down” by starting with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (like FilterableProductTable) or “bottom up” by working from components lower down (like ProductRow). In simpler examples, it’s usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it’s easier to go bottom-up.
(If this code looks intimidating, go through the Quick Start first!)
After building your components, you’ll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. Because this is a static app, the components will only return JSX. The component at the top of the hierarchy (FilterableProductTable) will take your data model as a prop. This is called one-way data flow because the data flows down from the top-level component to the ones at the bottom of the tree.
At this point, you should not be using any state values. That’s for the next step!
To make the UI interactive, you need to let users change your underlying data model. You will use state for this.
Think of state as the minimal set of changing data that your app needs to remember. The most important principle for structuring state is to keep it DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself). Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else on-demand. For example, if you’re building a shopping list, you can store the items as an array in state. If you want to also display the number of items in the list, don’t store the number of items as another state value—instead, read the length of your array.
Now think of all of the pieces of data in this example application:
The original list of products
The search text the user has entered
The value of the checkbox
The filtered list of products
Which of these are state? Identify the ones that are not:
Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it isn’t state.
Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it isn’t state.
Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component? If so, it definitely isn’t state!
What’s left is probably state.
Let’s go through them one by one again:
The original list of products is passed in as props, so it’s not state.
The search text seems to be state since it changes over time and can’t be computed from anything.
The value of the checkbox seems to be state since it changes over time and can’t be computed from anything.
The filtered list of products isn’t state because it can be computed by taking the original list of products and filtering it according to the search text and value of the checkbox.
This means only the search text and the value of the checkbox are state! Nicely done!




After identifying your app’s minimal state data, you need to identify which component is responsible for changing this state, or owns the state. Remember: React uses one-way data flow, passing data down the component hierarchy from parent to child component. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. This can be challenging if you’re new to this concept, but you can figure it out by following these steps!
For each piece of state in your application:
Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
Find their closest common parent component—a component above them all in the hierarchy.
Decide where the state should live:
Often, you can put the state directly into their common parent.
You can also put the state into some component above their common parent.
If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common parent component.
Often, you can put the state directly into their common parent.
You can also put the state into some component above their common parent.
If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common parent component.
In the previous step, you found two pieces of state in this application: the search input text, and the value of the checkbox. In this example, they always appear together, so it makes sense to put them into the same place.
Now let’s run through our strategy for them:
Identify components that use state:
ProductTable needs to filter the product list based on that state (search text and checkbox value).
SearchBar needs to display that state (search text and checkbox value).
ProductTable needs to filter the product list based on that state (search text and checkbox value).
SearchBar needs to display that state (search text and checkbox value).
Find their common parent: The first parent component both components share is FilterableProductTable.
Decide where the state lives: We’ll keep the filter text and checked state values in FilterableProductTable.
So the state values will live in FilterableProductTable.
Add state to the component with the useState() Hook. Hooks are special functions that let you “hook into” React. Add two state variables at the top of FilterableProductTable and specify their initial state:
Then, pass filterText and inStockOnly to ProductTable and SearchBar as props:
You can start seeing how your application will behave. Edit the filterText initial value from useState('') to useState('fruit') in the sandbox code below. You’ll see both the search input text and the table update:
Notice that editing the form doesn’t work yet. There is a console error in the sandbox above explaining why:
In the sandbox above, ProductTable and SearchBar read the filterText and inStockOnly props to render the table, the input, and the checkbox. For example, here is how SearchBar populates the input value:
However, you haven’t added any code to respond to the user actions like typing yet. This will be your final step.
Currently your app renders correctly with props and state flowing down the hierarchy. But to change the state according to user input, you will need to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in FilterableProductTable.
React makes this data flow explicit, but it requires a little more typing than two-way data binding. If you try to type or check the box in the example above, you’ll see that React ignores your input. This is intentional. By writing <input value={filterText} />, you’ve set the value prop of the input to always be equal to the filterText state passed in from FilterableProductTable. Since filterText state is never set, the input never changes.
You want to make it so whenever the user changes the form inputs, the state updates to reflect those changes. The state is owned by FilterableProductTable, so only it can call setFilterText and setInStockOnly. To let SearchBar update the FilterableProductTable’s state, you need to pass these functions down to SearchBar:
Inside the SearchBar, you will add the onChange event handlers and set the parent state from them:
Now the application fully works!
You can learn all about handling events and updating state in the Adding Interactivity section.
This was a very brief introduction to how to think about building components and applications with React. You can start a React project right now or dive deeper on all the syntax used in this tutorial.

# Which features make up the React team’s full-stack architecture vision?

If you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React, we recommend picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community.
You can use React without a framework, however we’ve found that most apps and sites eventually build solutions to common problems such as code-splitting, routing, data fetching, and generating HTML. These problems are common to all UI libraries, not just React.
By starting with a framework, you can get started with React quickly, and avoid essentially building your own framework later.






These frameworks support all the features you need to deploy and scale your app in production and are working towards supporting our full-stack architecture vision. All of the frameworks we recommend are open source with active communities for support, and can be deployed to your own server or a hosting provider. If you’re a framework author interested in being included on this list, please let us know.
Next.js’ Pages Router is a full-stack React framework. It’s versatile and lets you create React apps of any size—from a mostly static blog to a complex dynamic application. To create a new Next.js project, run in your terminal:
If you’re new to Next.js, check out the learn Next.js course.
Next.js is maintained by Vercel. You can deploy a Next.js app to any Node.js or serverless hosting, or to your own server. Next.js also supports a static export which doesn’t require a server.
Remix is a full-stack React framework with nested routing. It lets you break your app into nested parts that can load data in parallel and refresh in response to the user actions. To create a new Remix project, run:
If you’re new to Remix, check out the Remix blog tutorial (short) and app tutorial (long).
Remix is maintained by Shopify. When you create a Remix project, you need to pick your deployment target. You can deploy a Remix app to any Node.js or serverless hosting by using or writing an adapter.
Gatsby is a React framework for fast CMS-backed websites. Its rich plugin ecosystem and its GraphQL data layer simplify integrating content, APIs, and services into one website. To create a new Gatsby project, run:
If you’re new to Gatsby, check out the Gatsby tutorial.
Gatsby is maintained by Netlify. You can deploy a fully static Gatsby site to any static hosting. If you opt into using server-only features, make sure your hosting provider supports them for Gatsby.
Expo is a React framework that lets you create universal Android, iOS, and web apps with truly native UIs. It provides an SDK for React Native that makes the native parts easier to use. To create a new Expo project, run:
If you’re new to Expo, check out the Expo tutorial.
Expo is maintained by Expo (the company). Building apps with Expo is free, and you can submit them to the Google and Apple app stores without restrictions. Expo additionally provides opt-in paid cloud services.
As we’ve explored how to continue improving React, we realized that integrating React more closely with frameworks (specifically, with routing, bundling, and server technologies) is our biggest opportunity to help React users build better apps. The Next.js team has agreed to collaborate with us in researching, developing, integrating, and testing framework-agnostic bleeding-edge React features like React Server Components.
These features are getting closer to being production-ready every day, and we’ve been in talks with other bundler and framework developers about integrating them. Our hope is that in a year or two, all frameworks listed on this page will have full support for these features. (If you’re a framework author interested in partnering with us to experiment with these features, please let us know!)
Next.js’s App Router is a redesign of the Next.js APIs aiming to fulfill the React team’s full-stack architecture vision. It lets you fetch data in asynchronous components that run on the server or even during the build.
Next.js is maintained by Vercel. You can deploy a Next.js app to any Node.js or serverless hosting, or to your own server. Next.js also supports static export which doesn’t require a server.

# Add React to an Existing Project


# Note


# Using React for an entire subroute of your existing website


# Using React for a part of your existing page


# Step 1: Set up a modular JavaScript environment


# Note


# Step 2: Render React components anywhere on the page


# Using React Native in an existing native mobile app

If you want to add some interactivity to your existing project, you don’t have to rewrite it in React. Add React to your existing stack, and render interactive React components anywhere.
You need to install Node.js for local development. Although you can try React online or with a simple HTML page, realistically most JavaScript tooling you’ll want to use for development requires Node.js.
Let’s say you have an existing web app at example.com built with another server technology (like Rails), and you want to implement all routes starting with example.com/some-app/ fully with React.
Here’s how we recommend to set it up:
Build the React part of your app using one of the React-based frameworks.
Specify /some-app as the base path in your framework’s configuration (here’s how: Next.js, Gatsby).
Configure your server or a proxy so that all requests under /some-app/ are handled by your React app.
This ensures the React part of your app can benefit from the best practices baked into those frameworks.
Many React-based frameworks are full-stack and let your React app take advantage of the server. However, you can use the same approach even if you can’t or don’t want to run JavaScript on the server. In that case, serve the HTML/CSS/JS export (next export output for Next.js, default for Gatsby) at /some-app/ instead.
Let’s say you have an existing page built with another technology (either a server one like Rails, or a client one like Backbone), and you want to render interactive React components somewhere on that page. That’s a common way to integrate React—in fact, it’s how most React usage looked at Meta for many years!
You can do this in two steps:
Set up a JavaScript environment that lets you use the JSX syntax, split your code into modules with the import / export syntax, and use packages (for example, React) from the npm package registry.
Render your React components where you want to see them on the page.
The exact approach depends on your existing page setup, so let’s walk through some details.
A modular JavaScript environment lets you write your React components in individual files, as opposed to writing all of your code in a single file. It also lets you use all the wonderful packages published by other developers on the npm registry—including React itself! How you do this depends on your existing setup:
If your app is already split into files that use import statements, try to use the setup you already have. Check whether writing <div /> in your JS code causes a syntax error. If it causes a syntax error, you might need to transform your JavaScript code with Babel, and enable the Babel React preset to use JSX.

If it causes a syntax error, you might need to transform your JavaScript code with Babel, and enable the Babel React preset to use JSX.
If your app doesn’t have an existing setup for compiling JavaScript modules, set it up with Vite. The Vite community maintains many integrations with backend frameworks, including Rails, Django, and Laravel. If your backend framework is not listed, follow this guide to manually integrate Vite builds with your backend.
If your app doesn’t have an existing setup for compiling JavaScript modules, set it up with Vite. The Vite community maintains many integrations with backend frameworks, including Rails, Django, and Laravel. If your backend framework is not listed, follow this guide to manually integrate Vite builds with your backend.
To check whether your setup works, run this command in your project folder:
Then add these lines of code at the top of your main JavaScript file (it might be called index.js or main.js):
If the entire content of your page was replaced by a “Hello, world!”, everything worked! Keep reading.
Integrating a modular JavaScript environment into an existing project for the first time can feel intimidating, but it’s worth it! If you get stuck, try our community resources or the Vite Chat.
In the previous step, you put this code at the top of your main file:
Of course, you don’t actually want to clear the existing HTML content!
Delete this code.
Instead, you probably want to render your React components in specific places in your HTML. Open your HTML page (or the server templates that generate it) and add a unique id attribute to any tag, for example:
This lets you find that HTML element with document.getElementById and pass it to createRoot so that you can render your own React component inside:
Notice how the original HTML content from index.html is preserved, but your own NavigationBar React component now appears inside the <nav id=""navigation""> from your HTML. Read the createRoot usage documentation to learn more about rendering React components inside an existing HTML page.
When you adopt React in an existing project, it’s common to start with small interactive components (like buttons), and then gradually keep “moving upwards” until eventually your entire page is built with React. If you ever reach that point, we recommend migrating to a React framework right after to get the most out of React.
React Native can also be integrated into existing native apps incrementally. If you have an existing native app for Android (Java or Kotlin) or iOS (Objective-C or Swift), follow this guide to add a React Native screen to it.

```
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

// Clear the existing HTML content
document.body.innerHTML = '<div id=""app""></div>';

// Render your React component instead
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('app'));
root.render(<h1>Hello, world</h1>);
```


```
<!-- ... somewhere in your html ... -->
<nav id=""navigation""></nav>
<!-- ... more html ... -->

# Editor Setup


# You will learn


# Your editor


# Recommended text editor features


# Linting


# Formatting


# Formatting on save

A properly configured editor can make code clearer to read and faster to write. It can even help you catch bugs as you write them! If this is your first time setting up an editor or you’re looking to tune up your current editor, we have a few recommendations.
What the most popular editors are
How to format your code automatically
VS Code is one of the most popular editors in use today. It has a large marketplace of extensions and integrates well with popular services like GitHub. Most of the features listed below can be added to VS Code as extensions as well, making it highly configurable!
Other popular text editors used in the React community include:
WebStorm is an integrated development environment designed specifically for JavaScript.
Sublime Text has support for JSX and TypeScript, syntax highlighting and autocomplete built in.
Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. It is included as “vi” with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X.
Some editors come with these features built in, but others might require adding an extension. Check to see what support your editor of choice provides to be sure!
Code linters find problems in your code as you write, helping you fix them early. ESLint is a popular, open source linter for JavaScript.
Install ESLint with the recommended configuration for React (be sure you have Node installed!)
Integrate ESLint in VSCode with the official extension
Make sure that you’ve enabled all the eslint-plugin-react-hooks rules for your project. They are essential and catch the most severe bugs early. The recommended eslint-config-react-app preset already includes them.
The last thing you want to do when sharing your code with another contributor is get into a discussion about tabs vs spaces! Fortunately, Prettier will clean up your code by reformatting it to conform to preset, configurable rules. Run Prettier, and all your tabs will be converted to spaces—and your indentation, quotes, etc will also all be changed to conform to the configuration. In the ideal setup, Prettier will run when you save your file, quickly making these edits for you.
You can install the Prettier extension in VSCode by following these steps:
Launch VS Code
Use Quick Open (press Ctrl/Cmd+P)
Paste in ext install esbenp.prettier-vscode
Press Enter
Ideally, you should format your code on every save. VS Code has settings for this!
In VS Code, press CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + P.
Type “settings”
Hit Enter
In the search bar, type “format on save”
Be sure the “format on save” option is ticked!
If your ESLint preset has formatting rules, they may conflict with Prettier. We recommend disabling all formatting rules in your ESLint preset using eslint-config-prettier so that ESLint is only used for catching logical mistakes. If you want to enforce that files are formatted before a pull request is merged, use prettier --check for your continuous integration.""""""",644,3092,react

TypeScript is a popular way to add type definitions to JavaScript codebases. Out of the box, TypeScript supports JSX and you can get full React Web support by adding @types/react and @types/react-dom to your project.
TypeScript with React Components
Examples of typing with Hooks
Common types from @types/react
Further learning locations
All production-grade React frameworks offer support for using TypeScript. Follow the framework specific guide for installation:
Next.js
Remix
Gatsby
Expo
To install the latest version of React’s type definitions:
The following compiler options need to be set in your tsconfig.json:
dom must be included in lib (Note: If no lib option is specified, dom is included by default).
jsx must be set to one of the valid options. preserve should suffice for most applications. If you’re publishing a library, consult the jsx documentation on what value to choose.
Every file containing JSX must use the .tsx file extension. This is a TypeScript-specific extension that tells TypeScript that this file contains JSX.
Writing TypeScript with React is very similar to writing JavaScript with React. The key difference when working with a component is that you can provide types for your component’s props. These types can be used for correctness checking and providing inline documentation in editors.
Taking the MyButton component from the Quick Start guide, we can add a type describing the title for the button:
These sandboxes can handle TypeScript code, but they do not run the type-checker. This means you can amend the TypeScript sandboxes to learn, but you won’t get any type errors or warnings. To get type-checking, you can use the TypeScript Playground or use a more fully-featured online sandbox.
This inline syntax is the simplest way to provide types for a component, though once you start to have a few fields to describe it can become unwieldy. Instead, you can use an interface or type to describe the component’s props:
The type describing your component’s props can be as simple or as complex as you need, though they should be an object type described with either a type or interface. You can learn about how TypeScript describes objects in Object Types but you may also be interested in using Union Types to describe a prop that can be one of a few different types and the Creating Types from Types guide for more advanced use cases.
The type definitions from @types/react include types for the built-in Hooks, so you can use them in your components without any additional setup. They are built to take into account the code you write in your component, so you will get inferred types a lot of the time and ideally do not need to handle the minutiae of providing the types.
However, we can look at a few examples of how to provide types for Hooks.
The useState Hook will re-use the value passed in as the initial state to determine what the type of the value should be. For example:
This will assign the type of boolean to enabled, and setEnabled will be a function accepting either a boolean argument, or a function that returns a boolean. If you want to explicitly provide a type for the state, you can do so by providing a type argument to the useState call:
This isn’t very useful in this case, but a common case where you may want to provide a type is when you have a union type. For example, status here can be one of a few different strings:
Or, as recommended in Principles for structuring state, you can group related state as an object and describe the different possibilities via object types:
The useReducer Hook is a more complex Hook that takes a reducer function and an initial state. The types for the reducer function are inferred from the initial state. You can optionally provide a type argument to the useReducer call to provide a type for the state, but it is often better to set the type on the initial state instead:
We are using TypeScript in a few key places:
interface State describes the shape of the reducer’s state.
type CounterAction describes the different actions which can be dispatched to the reducer.
const initialState: State provides a type for the initial state, and also the type which is used by useReducer by default.
stateReducer(state: State, action: CounterAction): State sets the types for the reducer function’s arguments and return value.
A more explicit alternative to setting the type on initialState is to provide a type argument to useReducer:
The useContext Hook is a technique for passing data down the component tree without having to pass props through components. It is used by creating a provider component and often by creating a Hook to consume the value in a child component.
The type of the value provided by the context is inferred from the value passed to the createContext call:
This technique works when you have a default value which makes sense - but there are occasionally cases when you do not, and in those cases null can feel reasonable as a default value. However, to allow the type-system to understand your code, you need to explicitly set ContextShape | null on the createContext.
This causes the issue that you need to eliminate the | null in the type for context consumers. Our recommendation is to have the Hook do a runtime check for it’s existence and throw an error when not present:
The useMemo Hooks will create/re-access a memorized value from a function call, re-running the function only when dependencies passed as the 2nd parameter are changed. The result of calling the Hook is inferred from the return value from the function in the first parameter. You can be more explicit by providing a type argument to the Hook.
The useCallback provide a stable reference to a function as long as the dependencies passed into the second parameter are the same. Like useMemo, the function’s type is inferred from the return value of the function in the first parameter, and you can be more explicit by providing a type argument to the Hook.
When working in TypeScript strict mode useCallback requires adding types for the parameters in your callback. This is because the type of the callback is inferred from the return value of the function, and without parameters the type cannot be fully understood.
Depending on your code-style preferences, you could use the *EventHandler functions from the React types to provide the type for the event handler at the same time as defining the callback:
There is quite an expansive set of types which come from the @types/react package, it is worth a read when you feel comfortable with how React and TypeScript interact. You can find them in React’s folder in DefinitelyTyped. We will cover a few of the more common types here.
When working with DOM events in React, the type of the event can often be inferred from the event handler. However, when you want to extract a function to be passed to an event handler, you will need to explicitly set the type of the event.
There are many types of events provided in the React types - the full list can be found here which is based on the most popular events from the DOM.
When determining the type you are looking for you can first look at the hover information for the event handler you are using, which will show the type of the event.
If you need to use an event that is not included in this list, you can use the React.SyntheticEvent type, which is the base type for all events.
There are two common paths to describing the children of a component. The first is to use the React.ReactNode type, which is a union of all the possible types that can be passed as children in JSX:
This is a very broad definition of children. The second is to use the React.ReactElement type, which is only JSX elements and not JavaScript primitives like strings or numbers:
Note, that you cannot use TypeScript to describe that the children are a certain type of JSX elements, so you cannot use the type-system to describe a component which only accepts <li> children.
You can see an example of both React.ReactNode and React.ReactElement with the type-checker in this TypeScript playground.
When using inline styles in React, you can use React.CSSProperties to describe the object passed to the style prop. This type is a union of all the possible CSS properties, and is a good way to ensure you are passing valid CSS properties to the style prop, and to get auto-complete in your editor.

# React Developer Tools


# You will learn


# Browser extension


# Safari and other browsers


# Mobile (React Native)

Use React Developer Tools to inspect React components, edit props and state, and identify performance problems.
How to install React Developer Tools
The easiest way to debug websites built with React is to install the React Developer Tools browser extension. It is available for several popular browsers:
Install for Chrome
Install for Firefox
Install for Edge
Now, if you visit a website built with React, you will see the Components and Profiler panels.
For other browsers (for example, Safari), install the react-devtools npm package:
Next open the developer tools from the terminal:
Then connect your website by adding the following <script> tag to the beginning of your website’s <head>:
Reload your website in the browser now to view it in developer tools.
React Developer Tools can be used to inspect apps built with React Native as well.
The easiest way to use React Developer Tools is to install it globally:
Next open the developer tools from the terminal.
It should connect to any local React Native app that’s running.
Try reloading the app if developer tools doesn’t connect after a few seconds.

Getting started with the compiler
Installing the compiler and ESLint plugin
Troubleshooting
React Compiler is a new compiler currently in Beta, that we’ve open sourced to get early feedback from the community. While it has been used in production at companies like Meta, rolling out the compiler to production for your app will depend on the health of your codebase and how well you’ve followed the Rules of React.
The latest Beta release can be found with the @beta tag, and daily experimental releases with @experimental.
React Compiler is a new compiler that we’ve open sourced to get early feedback from the community. It is a build-time only tool that automatically optimizes your React app. It works with plain JavaScript, and understands the Rules of React, so you don’t need to rewrite any code to use it.
The compiler also includes an ESLint plugin that surfaces the analysis from the compiler right in your editor. We strongly recommend everyone use the linter today. The linter does not require that you have the compiler installed, so you can use it even if you are not ready to try out the compiler.
The compiler is currently released as beta, and is available to try out on React 17+ apps and libraries. To install the Beta:
Or, if you’re using Yarn:
If you are not using React 19 yet, please see the section below for further instructions.
In order to optimize applications, React Compiler automatically memoizes your code. You may be familiar today with memoization through APIs such as useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo. With these APIs you can tell React that certain parts of your application don’t need to recompute if their inputs haven’t changed, reducing work on updates. While powerful, it’s easy to forget to apply memoization or apply them incorrectly. This can lead to inefficient updates as React has to check parts of your UI that don’t have any meaningful changes.
The compiler uses its knowledge of JavaScript and React’s rules to automatically memoize values or groups of values within your components and hooks. If it detects breakages of the rules, it will automatically skip over just those components or hooks, and continue safely compiling other code.
React Compiler can statically detect when Rules of React are broken, and safely opt-out of optimizing just the affected components or hooks. It is not necessary for the compiler to optimize 100% of your codebase.
If your codebase is already very well-memoized, you might not expect to see major performance improvements with the compiler. However, in practice memoizing the correct dependencies that cause performance issues is tricky to get right by hand.














Please note that the compiler is still in Beta and has many rough edges. While it has been used in production at companies like Meta, rolling out the compiler to production for your app will depend on the health of your codebase and how well you’ve followed the Rules of React.
You don’t have to rush into using the compiler now. It’s okay to wait until it reaches a stable release before adopting it. However, we do appreciate trying it out in small experiments in your apps so that you can provide feedback to us to help make the compiler better.
In addition to these docs, we recommend checking the React Compiler Working Group for additional information and discussion about the compiler.
React Compiler also powers an ESLint plugin. The ESLint plugin can be used independently of the compiler, meaning you can use the ESLint plugin even if you don’t use the compiler.
Then, add it to your ESLint config:
Or, in the deprecated eslintrc config format:
The ESLint plugin will display any violations of the rules of React in your editor. When it does this, it means that the compiler has skipped over optimizing that component or hook. This is perfectly okay, and the compiler can recover and continue optimizing other components in your codebase.
You don’t have to fix all ESLint violations straight away. You can address them at your own pace to increase the amount of components and hooks being optimized, but it is not required to fix everything before you can use the compiler.
The compiler is designed to compile functional components and hooks that follow the Rules of React. It can also handle code that breaks those rules by bailing out (skipping over) those components or hooks. However, due to the flexible nature of JavaScript, the compiler cannot catch every possible violation and may compile with false negatives: that is, the compiler may accidentally compile a component/hook that breaks the Rules of React which can lead to undefined behavior.
For this reason, to adopt the compiler successfully on existing projects, we recommend running it on a small directory in your product code first. You can do this by configuring the compiler to only run on a specific set of directories:
When you have more confidence with rolling out the compiler, you can expand coverage to other directories as well and slowly roll it out to your whole app.
If you’re starting a new project, you can enable the compiler on your entire codebase, which is the default behavior.
React Compiler works best with React 19 RC. If you are unable to upgrade, you can install the extra react-compiler-runtime package which will allow the compiled code to run on versions prior to 19. However, note that the minimum supported version is 17.
You should also add the correct target to your compiler config, where target is the major version of React you are targeting:
React Compiler can also be used to compile libraries. Because React Compiler needs to run on the original source code prior to any code transformations, it is not possible for an application’s build pipeline to compile the libraries they use. Hence, our recommendation is for library maintainers to independently compile and test their libraries with the compiler, and ship compiled code to npm.
Because your code is pre-compiled, users of your library will not need to have the compiler enabled in order to benefit from the automatic memoization applied to your library. If your library targets apps not yet on React 19, specify a minimum target and add react-compiler-runtime as a direct dependency. The runtime package will use the correct implementation of APIs depending on the application’s version, and polyfill the missing APIs if necessary.
Library code can often require more complex patterns and usage of escape hatches. For this reason, we recommend ensuring that you have sufficient testing in order to identify any issues that might arise from using the compiler on your library. If you identify any issues, you can always opt-out the specific components or hooks with the 'use no memo' directive.
Similarly to apps, it is not necessary to fully compile 100% of your components or hooks to see benefits in your library. A good starting point might be to identify the most performance sensitive parts of your library and ensuring that they don’t break the Rules of React, which you can use eslint-plugin-react-compiler to identify.
The compiler includes a Babel plugin which you can use in your build pipeline to run the compiler.
After installing, add it to your Babel config. Please note that it’s critical that the compiler run first in the pipeline:
babel-plugin-react-compiler should run first before other Babel plugins as the compiler requires the input source information for sound analysis.
If you use Vite, you can add the plugin to vite-plugin-react:
Please refer to the Next.js docs for more information.
Install vite-plugin-babel, and add the compiler’s Babel plugin to it:
A community Webpack loader is now available here.
Please refer to Expo’s docs to enable and use the React Compiler in Expo apps.
React Native uses Babel via Metro, so refer to the Usage with Babel section for installation instructions.
Please refer to Rspack’s docs to enable and use the React Compiler in Rspack apps.
Please refer to Rsbuild’s docs to enable and use the React Compiler in Rsbuild apps.
To report issues, please first create a minimal repro on the React Compiler Playground and include it in your bug report. You can open issues in the facebook/react repo.
You can also provide feedback in the React Compiler Working Group by applying to be a member. Please see the README for more details on joining.
React Compiler assumes that your code:
Is valid, semantic JavaScript.
Tests that nullable/optional values and properties are defined before accessing them (for example, by enabling strictNullChecks if using TypeScript), i.e., if (object.nullableProperty) { object.nullableProperty.foo } or with optional-chaining object.nullableProperty?.foo.
Follows the Rules of React.
React Compiler can verify many of the Rules of React statically, and will safely skip compilation when it detects an error. To see the errors we recommend also installing eslint-plugin-react-compiler.
React Devtools (v5.0+) has built-in support for React Compiler and will display a “Memo ✨” badge next to components that have been optimized by the compiler.
If you have eslint-plugin-react-compiler installed, the compiler will display any violations of the rules of React in your editor. When it does this, it means that the compiler has skipped over optimizing that component or hook. This is perfectly okay, and the compiler can recover and continue optimizing other components in your codebase. You don’t have to fix all ESLint violations straight away. You can address them at your own pace to increase the amount of components and hooks being optimized.
Due to the flexible and dynamic nature of JavaScript however, it’s not possible to comprehensively detect all cases. Bugs and undefined behavior such as infinite loops may occur in those cases.
If your app doesn’t work properly after compilation and you aren’t seeing any ESLint errors, the compiler may be incorrectly compiling your code. To confirm this, try to make the issue go away by aggressively opting out any component or hook you think might be related via the ""use no memo"" directive.
""use no memo"" is a temporary escape hatch that lets you opt-out components and hooks from being compiled by the React Compiler. This directive is not meant to be long lived the same way as eg ""use client"" is.
It is not recommended to reach for this directive unless it’s strictly necessary. Once you opt-out a component or hook, it is opted-out forever until the directive is removed. This means that even if you fix the code, the compiler will still skip over compiling it unless you remove the directive.
When you make the error go away, confirm that removing the opt out directive makes the issue come back. Then share a bug report with us (you can try to reduce it to a small repro, or if it’s open source code you can also just paste the entire source) using the React Compiler Playground so we can identify and help fix the issue.

React is a JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (UI). UI is built from small units like buttons, text, and images. React lets you combine them into reusable, nestable components. From web sites to phone apps, everything on the screen can be broken down into components. In this chapter, you’ll learn to create, customize, and conditionally display React components.

Why understanding your UI as trees is useful
React applications are built from isolated pieces of UI called components. A React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup. Components can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page. Here is a Gallery component rendering three Profile components:
Read Your First Component to learn how to declare and use React components.
You can declare many components in one file, but large files can get difficult to navigate. To solve this, you can export a component into its own file, and then import that component from another file:
Read Importing and Exporting Components to learn how to split components into their own files.
Each React component is a JavaScript function that may contain some markup that React renders into the browser. React components use a syntax extension called JSX to represent that markup. JSX looks a lot like HTML, but it is a bit stricter and can display dynamic information.
If we paste existing HTML markup into a React component, it won’t always work:
If you have existing HTML like this, you can fix it using a converter:
Read Writing Markup with JSX to learn how to write valid JSX.
JSX lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file, keeping rendering logic and content in the same place. Sometimes you will want to add a little JavaScript logic or reference a dynamic property inside that markup. In this situation, you can use curly braces in your JSX to “open a window” to JavaScript:
Read JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces to learn how to access JavaScript data from JSX.
React components use props to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, functions, and even JSX!
Read Passing Props to a Component to learn how to pass and read props.
Your components will often need to display different things depending on different conditions. In React, you can conditionally render JSX using JavaScript syntax like if statements, &&, and ? : operators.
In this example, the JavaScript && operator is used to conditionally render a checkmark:
Read Conditional Rendering to learn the different ways to render content conditionally.
You will often want to display multiple similar components from a collection of data. You can use JavaScript’s filter() and map() with React to filter and transform your array of data into an array of components.
For each array item, you will need to specify a key. Usually, you will want to use an ID from the database as a key. Keys let React keep track of each item’s place in the list even if the list changes.
Read Rendering Lists to learn how to render a list of components, and how to choose a key.
Some JavaScript functions are pure. A pure function:
Minds its own business. It does not change any objects or variables that existed before it was called.
Same inputs, same output. Given the same inputs, a pure function should always return the same result.
By strictly only writing your components as pure functions, you can avoid an entire class of baffling bugs and unpredictable behavior as your codebase grows. Here is an example of an impure component:
You can make this component pure by passing a prop instead of modifying a preexisting variable:
Read Keeping Components Pure to learn how to write components as pure, predictable functions.
React uses trees to model the relationships between components and modules.
A React render tree is a representation of the parent and child relationship between components.
An example React render tree.
Components near the top of the tree, near the root component, are considered top-level components. Components with no child components are leaf components. This categorization of components is useful for understanding data flow and rendering performance.
Modelling the relationship between JavaScript modules is another useful way to understand your app. We refer to it as a module dependency tree.
An example module dependency tree.
A dependency tree is often used by build tools to bundle all the relevant JavaScript code for the client to download and render. A large bundle size regresses user experience for React apps. Understanding the module dependency tree is helpful to debug such issues.

Components are one of the core concepts of React. They are the foundation upon which you build user interfaces (UI), which makes them the perfect place to start your React journey!
What a component is
What role components play in a React application
How to write your first React component
On the Web, HTML lets us create rich structured documents with its built-in set of tags like <h1> and <li>:
This markup represents this article <article>, its heading <h1>, and an (abbreviated) table of contents as an ordered list <ol>. Markup like this, combined with CSS for style, and JavaScript for interactivity, lies behind every sidebar, avatar, modal, dropdown—every piece of UI you see on the Web.
React lets you combine your markup, CSS, and JavaScript into custom “components”, reusable UI elements for your app. The table of contents code you saw above could be turned into a <TableOfContents /> component you could render on every page. Under the hood, it still uses the same HTML tags like <article>, <h1>, etc.
Just like with HTML tags, you can compose, order and nest components to design whole pages. For example, the documentation page you’re reading is made out of React components:
As your project grows, you will notice that many of your designs can be composed by reusing components you already wrote, speeding up your development. Our table of contents above could be added to any screen with <TableOfContents />! You can even jumpstart your project with the thousands of components shared by the React open source community like Chakra UI and Material UI.
Traditionally when creating web pages, web developers marked up their content and then added interaction by sprinkling on some JavaScript. This worked great when interaction was a nice-to-have on the web. Now it is expected for many sites and all apps. React puts interactivity first while still using the same technology: a React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup. Here’s what that looks like (you can edit the example below):
And here’s how to build a component:
The export default prefix is a standard JavaScript syntax (not specific to React). It lets you mark the main function in a file so that you can later import it from other files. (More on importing in Importing and Exporting Components!)
With function Profile() { } you define a JavaScript function with the name Profile.
React components are regular JavaScript functions, but their names must start with a capital letter or they won’t work!
The component returns an <img /> tag with src and alt attributes. <img /> is written like HTML, but it is actually JavaScript under the hood! This syntax is called JSX, and it lets you embed markup inside JavaScript.
Return statements can be written all on one line, as in this component:
But if your markup isn’t all on the same line as the return keyword, you must wrap it in a pair of parentheses:
Without parentheses, any code on the lines after return will be ignored!
Now that you’ve defined your Profile component, you can nest it inside other components. For example, you can export a Gallery component that uses multiple Profile components:
Notice the difference in casing:
<section> is lowercase, so React knows we refer to an HTML tag.
<Profile /> starts with a capital P, so React knows that we want to use our component called Profile.
And Profile contains even more HTML: <img />. In the end, this is what the browser sees:
Components are regular JavaScript functions, so you can keep multiple components in the same file. This is convenient when components are relatively small or tightly related to each other. If this file gets crowded, you can always move Profile to a separate file. You will learn how to do this shortly on the page about imports.
Because the Profile components are rendered inside Gallery—even several times!—we can say that Gallery is a parent component, rendering each Profile as a “child”. This is part of the magic of React: you can define a component once, and then use it in as many places and as many times as you like.
Components can render other components, but you must never nest their definitions:
The snippet above is very slow and causes bugs. Instead, define every component at the top level:
When a child component needs some data from a parent, pass it by props instead of nesting definitions.




You’ve just gotten your first taste of React! Let’s recap some key points.
React lets you create components, reusable UI elements for your app.

# Challenge 1 of 1: Split the components further

The magic of components lies in their reusability: you can create components that are composed of other components. But as you nest more and more components, it often makes sense to start splitting them into different files. This lets you keep your files easy to scan and reuse components in more places.
What a root component file is
How to import and export a component
When to use default and named imports and exports
How to import and export multiple components from one file
How to split components into multiple files
In Your First Component, you made a Profile component and a Gallery component that renders it:
These currently live in a root component file, named App.js in this example. Depending on your setup, your root component could be in another file, though. If you use a framework with file-based routing, such as Next.js, your root component will be different for every page.
What if you want to change the landing screen in the future and put a list of science books there? Or place all the profiles somewhere else? It makes sense to move Gallery and Profile out of the root component file. This will make them more modular and reusable in other files. You can move a component in three steps:
Make a new JS file to put the components in.
Export your function component from that file (using either default or named exports).
Import it in the file where you’ll use the component (using the corresponding technique for importing default or named exports).
Here both Profile and Gallery have been moved out of App.js into a new file called Gallery.js. Now you can change App.js to import Gallery from Gallery.js:
Notice how this example is broken down into two component files now:
Gallery.js:
Defines the Profile component which is only used within the same file and is not exported.
Exports the Gallery component as a default export.
Defines the Profile component which is only used within the same file and is not exported.
Exports the Gallery component as a default export.
App.js:
Imports Gallery as a default import from Gallery.js.
Exports the root App component as a default export.
Imports Gallery as a default import from Gallery.js.
Exports the root App component as a default export.
You may encounter files that leave off the .js file extension like so:
Either './Gallery.js' or './Gallery' will work with React, though the former is closer to how native ES Modules work.




What if you want to show just one Profile instead of a gallery? You can export the Profile component, too. But Gallery.js already has a default export, and you can’t have two default exports. You could create a new file with a default export, or you could add a named export for Profile. A file can only have one default export, but it can have numerous named exports!
To reduce the potential confusion between default and named exports, some teams choose to only stick to one style (default or named), or avoid mixing them in a single file. Do what works best for you!
First, export Profile from Gallery.js using a named export (no default keyword):
Then, import Profile from Gallery.js to App.js using a named import (with the curly braces):
Finally, render <Profile /> from the App component:
Now Gallery.js contains two exports: a default Gallery export, and a named Profile export. App.js imports both of them. Try editing <Profile /> to <Gallery /> and back in this example:
Now you’re using a mix of default and named exports:
Gallery.js:
Exports the Profile component as a named export called Profile.
Exports the Gallery component as a default export.
Exports the Profile component as a named export called Profile.
Exports the Gallery component as a default export.
App.js:
Imports Profile as a named import called Profile from Gallery.js.
Imports Gallery as a default import from Gallery.js.
Exports the root App component as a default export.
Imports Profile as a named import called Profile from Gallery.js.
Imports Gallery as a default import from Gallery.js.
Exports the root App component as a default export.

Currently, Gallery.js exports both Profile and Gallery, which is a bit confusing.
Move the Profile component to its own Profile.js, and then change the App component to render both <Profile /> and <Gallery /> one after another.
You may use either a default or a named export for Profile, but make sure that you use the corresponding import syntax in both App.js and Gallery.js! You can refer to the table from the deep dive above:
After you get it working with one kind of exports, make it work with the other kind.

```
import Gallery from './Gallery';
```


```
export function Profile() {
  // ...

import { Profile } from './Gallery.js';
```

export default function App() {
  return <Profile />;

# Challenge 1 of 1: Convert some HTML to JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file. Although there are other ways to write components, most React developers prefer the conciseness of JSX, and most codebases use it.
Why React mixes markup with rendering logic
How JSX is different from HTML
How to display information with JSX
The Web has been built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For many years, web developers kept content in HTML, design in CSS, and logic in JavaScript—often in separate files! Content was marked up inside HTML while the page’s logic lived separately in JavaScript:
HTML
JavaScript
But as the Web became more interactive, logic increasingly determined content. JavaScript was in charge of the HTML! This is why in React, rendering logic and markup live together in the same place—components.
Sidebar.js React component
Form.js React component
Keeping a button’s rendering logic and markup together ensures that they stay in sync with each other on every edit. Conversely, details that are unrelated, such as the button’s markup and a sidebar’s markup, are isolated from each other, making it safer to change either of them on their own.
Each React component is a JavaScript function that may contain some markup that React renders into the browser. React components use a syntax extension called JSX to represent that markup. JSX looks a lot like HTML, but it is a bit stricter and can display dynamic information. The best way to understand this is to convert some HTML markup to JSX markup.
JSX and React are two separate things. They’re often used together, but you can use them independently of each other. JSX is a syntax extension, while React is a JavaScript library.
Suppose that you have some (perfectly valid) HTML:
And you want to put it into your component:
If you copy and paste it as is, it will not work:
This is because JSX is stricter and has a few more rules than HTML! If you read the error messages above, they’ll guide you to fix the markup, or you can follow the guide below.
Most of the time, React’s on-screen error messages will help you find where the problem is. Give them a read if you get stuck!
To return multiple elements from a component, wrap them with a single parent tag.
For example, you can use a <div>:
If you don’t want to add an extra <div> to your markup, you can write <> and </> instead:
This empty tag is called a Fragment. Fragments let you group things without leaving any trace in the browser HTML tree.

JSX requires tags to be explicitly closed: self-closing tags like <img> must become <img />, and wrapping tags like <li>oranges must be written as <li>oranges</li>.
This is how Hedy Lamarr’s image and list items look closed:
JSX turns into JavaScript and attributes written in JSX become keys of JavaScript objects. In your own components, you will often want to read those attributes into variables. But JavaScript has limitations on variable names. For example, their names can’t contain dashes or be reserved words like class.
This is why, in React, many HTML and SVG attributes are written in camelCase. For example, instead of stroke-width you use strokeWidth. Since class is a reserved word, in React you write className instead, named after the corresponding DOM property:
You can find all these attributes in the list of DOM component props. If you get one wrong, don’t worry—React will print a message with a possible correction to the browser console.
For historical reasons, aria-* and data-* attributes are written as in HTML with dashes.
Converting all these attributes in existing markup can be tedious! We recommend using a converter to translate your existing HTML and SVG to JSX. Converters are very useful in practice, but it’s still worth understanding what is going on so that you can comfortably write JSX on your own.
Here is your final result:
Now you know why JSX exists and how to use it in components:
React components group rendering logic together with markup because they are related.
JSX is similar to HTML, with a few differences. You can use a converter if you need to.
Error messages will often point you in the right direction to fixing your markup.
This HTML was pasted into a component, but it’s not valid JSX. Fix it:
Whether to do it by hand or using the converter is up to you!

# Challenge 1 of 3: Fix the mistake

JSX lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file, keeping rendering logic and content in the same place. Sometimes you will want to add a little JavaScript logic or reference a dynamic property inside that markup. In this situation, you can use curly braces in your JSX to open a window to JavaScript.
How to pass strings with quotes
How to reference a JavaScript variable inside JSX with curly braces
How to call a JavaScript function inside JSX with curly braces
How to use a JavaScript object inside JSX with curly braces
When you want to pass a string attribute to JSX, you put it in single or double quotes:
Here, ""https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg"" and ""Gregorio Y. Zara"" are being passed as strings.
But what if you want to dynamically specify the src or alt text? You could use a value from JavaScript by replacing "" and "" with { and }:
Notice the difference between className=""avatar"", which specifies an ""avatar"" CSS class name that makes the image round, and src={avatar} that reads the value of the JavaScript variable called avatar. That’s because curly braces let you work with JavaScript right there in your markup!
JSX is a special way of writing JavaScript. That means it’s possible to use JavaScript inside it—with curly braces { }. The example below first declares a name for the scientist, name, then embeds it with curly braces inside the <h1>:
Try changing the name’s value from 'Gregorio Y. Zara' to 'Hedy Lamarr'. See how the list title changes?
Any JavaScript expression will work between curly braces, including function calls like formatDate():
You can only use curly braces in two ways inside JSX:
As text directly inside a JSX tag: <h1>{name}'s To Do List</h1> works, but <{tag}>Gregorio Y. Zara's To Do List</{tag}> will not.
As attributes immediately following the = sign: src={avatar} will read the avatar variable, but src=""{avatar}"" will pass the string ""{avatar}"".
In addition to strings, numbers, and other JavaScript expressions, you can even pass objects in JSX. Objects are also denoted with curly braces, like { name: ""Hedy Lamarr"", inventions: 5 }. Therefore, to pass a JS object in JSX, you must wrap the object in another pair of curly braces: person={{ name: ""Hedy Lamarr"", inventions: 5 }}.
You may see this with inline CSS styles in JSX. React does not require you to use inline styles (CSS classes work great for most cases). But when you need an inline style, you pass an object to the style attribute:
Try changing the values of backgroundColor and color.
You can really see the JavaScript object inside the curly braces when you write it like this:
The next time you see {{ and }} in JSX, know that it’s nothing more than an object inside the JSX curlies!
Inline style properties are written in camelCase. For example, HTML <ul style=""background-color: black""> would be written as <ul style={{ backgroundColor: 'black' }}>  in your component.
You can move several expressions into one object, and reference them in your JSX inside curly braces:
In this example, the person JavaScript object contains a name string and a theme object:
The component can use these values from person like so:
JSX is very minimal as a templating language because it lets you organize data and logic using JavaScript.
Now you know almost everything about JSX:
JSX attributes inside quotes are passed as strings.
Curly braces let you bring JavaScript logic and variables into your markup.
They work inside the JSX tag content or immediately after = in attributes.
{{ and }} is not special syntax: it’s a JavaScript object tucked inside JSX curly braces.
This code crashes with an error saying Objects are not valid as a React child:
Can you find the problem?

```
<ul style={
  {
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    color: 'pink'
  }
}>
```


```
const person = {
  name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara',
  theme: {
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    color: 'pink'
  }
};
```


```
<div style={person.theme}>
  <h1>{person.name}'s Todos</h1>

# Challenge 1 of 3: Extract a component

React components use props to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.
How to pass props to a component
How to read props from a component
How to specify default values for props
How to pass some JSX to a component
How props change over time
Props are the information that you pass to a JSX tag. For example, className, src, alt, width, and height are some of the props you can pass to an <img>:
The props you can pass to an <img> tag are predefined (ReactDOM conforms to the HTML standard). But you can pass any props to your own components, such as <Avatar>, to customize them. Here’s how!
In this code, the Profile component isn’t passing any props to its child component, Avatar:
You can give Avatar some props in two steps.
First, pass some props to Avatar. For example, let’s pass two props: person (an object), and size (a number):
If double curly braces after person= confuse you, recall they’re merely an object inside the JSX curlies.
Now you can read these props inside the Avatar component.
You can read these props by listing their names person, size separated by the commas inside ({ and }) directly after function Avatar. This lets you use them inside the Avatar code, like you would with a variable.
Add some logic to Avatar that uses the person and size props for rendering, and you’re done.
Now you can configure Avatar to render in many different ways with different props. Try tweaking the values!
Props let you think about parent and child components independently. For example, you can change the person or the size props inside Profile without having to think about how Avatar uses them. Similarly, you can change how the Avatar uses these props, without looking at the Profile.
You can think of props like “knobs” that you can adjust. They serve the same role as arguments serve for functions—in fact, props are the only argument to your component! React component functions accept a single argument, a props object:
Usually you don’t need the whole props object itself, so you destructure it into individual props.
Don’t miss the pair of { and } curlies inside of ( and ) when declaring props:
This syntax is called “destructuring” and is equivalent to reading properties from a function parameter:
If you want to give a prop a default value to fall back on when no value is specified, you can do it with the destructuring by putting = and the default value right after the parameter:
Now, if <Avatar person={...} /> is rendered with no size prop, the size will be set to 100.
The default value is only used if the size prop is missing or if you pass size={undefined}. But if you pass size={null} or size={0}, the default value will not be used.
Sometimes, passing props gets very repetitive:
There’s nothing wrong with repetitive code—it can be more legible. But at times you may value conciseness. Some components forward all of their props to their children, like how this Profile does with Avatar. Because they don’t use any of their props directly, it can make sense to use a more concise “spread” syntax:
This forwards all of Profile’s props to the Avatar without listing each of their names.
Use spread syntax with restraint. If you’re using it in every other component, something is wrong. Often, it indicates that you should split your components and pass children as JSX. More on that next!
It is common to nest built-in browser tags:
Sometimes you’ll want to nest your own components the same way:
When you nest content inside a JSX tag, the parent component will receive that content in a prop called children. For example, the Card component below will receive a children prop set to <Avatar /> and render it in a wrapper div:
Try replacing the <Avatar> inside <Card> with some text to see how the Card component can wrap any nested content. It doesn’t need to “know” what’s being rendered inside of it. You will see this flexible pattern in many places.
You can think of a component with a children prop as having a “hole” that can be “filled in” by its parent components with arbitrary JSX. You will often use the children prop for visual wrappers: panels, grids, etc.

The Clock component below receives two props from its parent component: color and time. (The parent component’s code is omitted because it uses state, which we won’t dive into just yet.)
Try changing the color in the select box below:
This example illustrates that a component may receive different props over time. Props are not always static! Here, the time prop changes every second, and the color prop changes when you select another color. Props reflect a component’s data at any point in time, rather than only in the beginning.
However, props are immutable—a term from computer science meaning “unchangeable”. When a component needs to change its props (for example, in response to a user interaction or new data), it will have to “ask” its parent component to pass it different props—a new object! Its old props will then be cast aside, and eventually the JavaScript engine will reclaim the memory taken by them.
Don’t try to “change props”. When you need to respond to the user input (like changing the selected color), you will need to “set state”, which you can learn about in State: A Component’s Memory.
To pass props, add them to the JSX, just like you would with HTML attributes.
To read props, use the function Avatar({ person, size }) destructuring syntax.
You can specify a default value like size = 100, which is used for missing and undefined props.
You can forward all props with <Avatar {...props} /> JSX spread syntax, but don’t overuse it!
Nested JSX like <Card><Avatar /></Card> will appear as Card component’s children prop.
Props are read-only snapshots in time: every render receives a new version of props.
You can’t change props. When you need interactivity, you’ll need to set state.
This Gallery component contains some very similar markup for two profiles. Extract a Profile component out of it to reduce the duplication. You’ll need to choose what props to pass to it.

```
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar />
  );
}
```


```
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar
      person={{ name: 'Lin Lanying', imageId: '1bX5QH6' }}
      size={100}
    />
  );
}
```


```
function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  // person and size are available here
}
```


```
function Avatar(props) {
  let person = props.person;
  let size = props.size;
  // ...
}
```


```
function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  // ...
}

function Avatar(props) {
  let person = props.person;
  let size = props.size;

# Challenge 1 of 3: Show an icon for incomplete items with ? :

Your components will often need to display different things depending on different conditions. In React, you can conditionally render JSX using JavaScript syntax like if statements, &&, and ? : operators.
How to return different JSX depending on a condition
How to conditionally include or exclude a piece of JSX
Common conditional syntax shortcuts you’ll encounter in React codebases
Let’s say you have a PackingList component rendering several Items, which can be marked as packed or not:
Notice that some of the Item components have their isPacked prop set to true instead of false. You want to add a checkmark (✅) to packed items if isPacked={true}.
You can write this as an if/else statement like so:
If the isPacked prop is true, this code returns a different JSX tree. With this change, some of the items get a checkmark at the end:
Try editing what gets returned in either case, and see how the result changes!
Notice how you’re creating branching logic with JavaScript’s if and return statements. In React, control flow (like conditions) is handled by JavaScript.
In some situations, you won’t want to render anything at all. For example, say you don’t want to show packed items at all. A component must return something. In this case, you can return null:
If isPacked is true, the component will return nothing, null. Otherwise, it will return JSX to render.
In practice, returning null from a component isn’t common because it might surprise a developer trying to render it. More often, you would conditionally include or exclude the component in the parent component’s JSX. Here’s how to do that!
In the previous example, you controlled which (if any!) JSX tree would be returned by the component. You may already have noticed some duplication in the render output:
is very similar to
Both of the conditional branches return <li className=""item"">...</li>:
While this duplication isn’t harmful, it could make your code harder to maintain. What if you want to change the className? You’d have to do it in two places in your code! In such a situation, you could conditionally include a little JSX to make your code more DRY.
JavaScript has a compact syntax for writing a conditional expression — the conditional operator or “ternary operator”.
Instead of this:
You can write this:
You can read it as “if isPacked is true, then (?) render name + ' ✅', otherwise (:) render name”.

Now let’s say you want to wrap the completed item’s text into another HTML tag, like <del> to strike it out. You can add even more newlines and parentheses so that it’s easier to nest more JSX in each of the cases:
This style works well for simple conditions, but use it in moderation. If your components get messy with too much nested conditional markup, consider extracting child components to clean things up. In React, markup is a part of your code, so you can use tools like variables and functions to tidy up complex expressions.
Another common shortcut you’ll encounter is the JavaScript logical AND (&&) operator. Inside React components, it often comes up when you want to render some JSX when the condition is true, or render nothing otherwise. With &&, you could conditionally render the checkmark only if isPacked is true:
You can read this as “if isPacked, then (&&) render the checkmark, otherwise, render nothing”.
Here it is in action:
A JavaScript && expression returns the value of its right side (in our case, the checkmark) if the left side (our condition) is true. But if the condition is false, the whole expression becomes false. React considers false as a “hole” in the JSX tree, just like null or undefined, and doesn’t render anything in its place.
Don’t put numbers on the left side of &&.
To test the condition, JavaScript converts the left side to a boolean automatically. However, if the left side is 0, then the whole expression gets that value (0), and React will happily render 0 rather than nothing.
For example, a common mistake is to write code like messageCount && <p>New messages</p>. It’s easy to assume that it renders nothing when messageCount is 0, but it really renders the 0 itself!
To fix it, make the left side a boolean: messageCount > 0 && <p>New messages</p>.
When the shortcuts get in the way of writing plain code, try using an if statement and a variable. You can reassign variables defined with let, so start by providing the default content you want to display, the name:
Use an if statement to reassign a JSX expression to itemContent if isPacked is true:
Curly braces open the “window into JavaScript”. Embed the variable with curly braces in the returned JSX tree, nesting the previously calculated expression inside of JSX:
This style is the most verbose, but it’s also the most flexible. Here it is in action:
Like before, this works not only for text, but for arbitrary JSX too:
If you’re not familiar with JavaScript, this variety of styles might seem overwhelming at first. However, learning them will help you read and write any JavaScript code — and not just React components! Pick the one you prefer for a start, and then consult this reference again if you forget how the other ones work.
In React, you control branching logic with JavaScript.
You can return a JSX expression conditionally with an if statement.
You can conditionally save some JSX to a variable and then include it inside other JSX by using the curly braces.
In JSX, {cond ? <A /> : <B />} means “if cond, render <A />, otherwise <B />”.
In JSX, {cond && <A />} means “if cond, render <A />, otherwise nothing”.
The shortcuts are common, but you don’t have to use them if you prefer plain if.
Use the conditional operator (cond ? a : b) to render a ❌ if isPacked isn’t true.

```
if (isPacked) {
  return <li className=""item"">{name} ✅</li>;
}
return <li className=""item"">{name}</li>;
```


```
if (isPacked) {
  return null;
}
return <li className=""item"">{name}</li>;
```


```
<li className=""item"">{name} ✅</li>
```


```
<li className=""item"">{name}</li>
```


```
if (isPacked) {
  return <li className=""item"">{name} ✅</li>;
}

```


```

# Challenge 1 of 4: Splitting a list in two

You will often want to display multiple similar components from a collection of data. You can use the JavaScript array methods to manipulate an array of data. On this page, you’ll use filter() and map() with React to filter and transform your array of data into an array of components.
How to render components from an array using JavaScript’s map()
How to render only specific components using JavaScript’s filter()
When and why to use React keys
Say that you have a list of content.
The only difference among those list items is their contents, their data. You will often need to show several instances of the same component using different data when building interfaces: from lists of comments to galleries of profile images. In these situations, you can store that data in JavaScript objects and arrays and use methods like map() and filter() to render lists of components from them.
Here’s a short example of how to generate a list of items from an array:
Move the data into an array:
Map the people members into a new array of JSX nodes, listItems:
Return listItems from your component wrapped in a <ul>:
Here is the result:
Notice the sandbox above displays a console error:
You’ll learn how to fix this error later on this page. Before we get to that, let’s add some structure to your data.
This data can be structured even more.
Let’s say you want a way to only show people whose profession is 'chemist'. You can use JavaScript’s filter() method to return just those people. This method takes an array of items, passes them through a “test” (a function that returns true or false), and returns a new array of only those items that passed the test (returned true).
You only want the items where profession is 'chemist'. The “test” function for this looks like (person) => person.profession === 'chemist'. Here’s how to put it together:
Create a new array of just “chemist” people, chemists, by calling filter() on the people filtering by person.profession === 'chemist':
Now map over chemists:
Lastly, return the listItems from your component:
Arrow functions implicitly return the expression right after =>, so you didn’t need a return statement:
However, you must write return explicitly if your => is followed by a { curly brace!
Arrow functions containing => { are said to have a “block body”. They let you write more than a single line of code, but you have to write a return statement yourself. If you forget it, nothing gets returned!
Notice that all the sandboxes above show an error in the console:
You need to give each array item a key — a string or a number that uniquely identifies it among other items in that array:
JSX elements directly inside a map() call always need keys!
Keys tell React which array item each component corresponds to, so that it can match them up later. This becomes important if your array items can move (e.g. due to sorting), get inserted, or get deleted. A well-chosen key helps React infer what exactly has happened, and make the correct updates to the DOM tree.
Rather than generating keys on the fly, you should include them in your data:



Different sources of data provide different sources of keys:
Data from a database: If your data is coming from a database, you can use the database keys/IDs, which are unique by nature.
Locally generated data: If your data is generated and persisted locally (e.g. notes in a note-taking app), use an incrementing counter, crypto.randomUUID() or a package like uuid when creating items.
Keys must be unique among siblings. However, it’s okay to use the same keys for JSX nodes in different arrays.
Keys must not change or that defeats their purpose! Don’t generate them while rendering.
Imagine that files on your desktop didn’t have names. Instead, you’d refer to them by their order — the first file, the second file, and so on. You could get used to it, but once you delete a file, it would get confusing. The second file would become the first file, the third file would be the second file, and so on.
File names in a folder and JSX keys in an array serve a similar purpose. They let us uniquely identify an item between its siblings. A well-chosen key provides more information than the position within the array. Even if the position changes due to reordering, the key lets React identify the item throughout its lifetime.
You might be tempted to use an item’s index in the array as its key. In fact, that’s what React will use if you don’t specify a key at all. But the order in which you render items will change over time if an item is inserted, deleted, or if the array gets reordered. Index as a key often leads to subtle and confusing bugs.
Similarly, do not generate keys on the fly, e.g. with key={Math.random()}. This will cause keys to never match up between renders, leading to all your components and DOM being recreated every time. Not only is this slow, but it will also lose any user input inside the list items. Instead, use a stable ID based on the data.
Note that your components won’t receive key as a prop. It’s only used as a hint by React itself. If your component needs an ID, you have to pass it as a separate prop: <Profile key={id} userId={id} />.

# Challenge 1 of 3: Fix a broken clock

Some JavaScript functions are pure. Pure functions only perform a calculation and nothing more. By strictly only writing your components as pure functions, you can avoid an entire class of baffling bugs and unpredictable behavior as your codebase grows. To get these benefits, though, there are a few rules you must follow.
What purity is and how it helps you avoid bugs
How to keep components pure by keeping changes out of the render phase
How to use Strict Mode to find mistakes in your components
In computer science (and especially the world of functional programming), a pure function is a function with the following characteristics:
It minds its own business. It does not change any objects or variables that existed before it was called.
Same inputs, same output. Given the same inputs, a pure function should always return the same result.
You might already be familiar with one example of pure functions: formulas in math.
Consider this math formula: y = 2x.
If x = 2 then y = 4. Always.
If x = 3 then y = 6. Always.
If x = 3, y won’t sometimes be 9 or –1 or 2.5 depending on the time of day or the state of the stock market.
If y = 2x and x = 3, y will always be 6.
If we made this into a JavaScript function, it would look like this:
In the above example, double is a pure function. If you pass it 3, it will return 6. Always.
React is designed around this concept. React assumes that every component you write is a pure function. This means that React components you write must always return the same JSX given the same inputs:
When you pass drinkers={2} to Recipe, it will return JSX containing 2 cups of water. Always.
If you pass drinkers={4}, it will return JSX containing 4 cups of water. Always.
Just like a math formula.
You could think of your components as recipes: if you follow them and don’t introduce new ingredients during the cooking process, you will get the same dish every time. That “dish” is the JSX that the component serves to React to render.

React’s rendering process must always be pure. Components should only return their JSX, and not change any objects or variables that existed before rendering—that would make them impure!
Here is a component that breaks this rule:
This component is reading and writing a guest variable declared outside of it. This means that calling this component multiple times will produce different JSX! And what’s more, if other components read guest, they will produce different JSX, too, depending on when they were rendered! That’s not predictable.
Going back to our formula y = 2x, now even if x = 2, we cannot trust that y = 4. Our tests could fail, our users would be baffled, planes would fall out of the sky—you can see how this would lead to confusing bugs!
You can fix this component by passing guest as a prop instead:
Now your component is pure, as the JSX it returns only depends on the guest prop.
In general, you should not expect your components to be rendered in any particular order. It doesn’t matter if you call y = 2x before or after y = 5x: both formulas will resolve independently of each other. In the same way, each component should only “think for itself”, and not attempt to coordinate with or depend upon others during rendering. Rendering is like a school exam: each component should calculate JSX on their own!





In the above example, the problem was that the component changed a preexisting variable while rendering. This is often called a “mutation” to make it sound a bit scarier. Pure functions don’t mutate variables outside of the function’s scope or objects that were created before the call—that makes them impure!
However, it’s completely fine to change variables and objects that you’ve just created while rendering. In this example, you create an [] array, assign it to a cups variable, and then push a dozen cups into it:
If the cups variable or the [] array were created outside the TeaGathering function, this would be a huge problem! You would be changing a preexisting object by pushing items into that array.
However, it’s fine because you’ve created them during the same render, inside TeaGathering. No code outside of TeaGathering will ever know that this happened. This is called “local mutation”—it’s like your component’s little secret.
While functional programming relies heavily on purity, at some point, somewhere, something has to change. That’s kind of the point of programming! These changes—updating the screen, starting an animation, changing the data—are called side effects. They’re things that happen “on the side”, not during rendering.
In React, side effects usually belong inside event handlers. Event handlers are functions that React runs when you perform some action—for example, when you click a button. Even though event handlers are defined inside your component, they don’t run during rendering! So event handlers don’t need to be pure.
If you’ve exhausted all other options and can’t find the right event handler for your side effect, you can still attach it to your returned JSX with a useEffect call in your component. This tells React to execute it later, after rendering, when side effects are allowed. However, this approach should be your last resort.
When possible, try to express your logic with rendering alone. You’ll be surprised how far this can take you!





A component must be pure, meaning:
It minds its own business. It should not change any objects or variables that existed before rendering.
Same inputs, same output. Given the same inputs, a component should always return the same JSX.
It minds its own business. It should not change any objects or variables that existed before rendering.
Same inputs, same output. Given the same inputs, a component should always return the same JSX.
Rendering can happen at any time, so components should not depend on each others’ rendering sequence.
You should not mutate any of the inputs that your components use for rendering. That includes props, state, and context. To update the screen, “set” state instead of mutating preexisting objects.
Strive to express your component’s logic in the JSX you return. When you need to “change things”, you’ll usually want to do it in an event handler. As a last resort, you can useEffect.
Writing pure functions takes a bit of practice, but it unlocks the power of React’s paradigm.
This component tries to set the <h1>’s CSS class to ""night"" during the time from midnight to six hours in the morning, and ""day"" at all other times. However, it doesn’t work. Can you fix this component?
You can verify whether your solution works by temporarily changing the computer’s timezone. When the current time is between midnight and six in the morning, the clock should have inverted colors!

  return 2 * number;

# Understanding Your UI as a Tree

# Your UI as a tree

# DEEP DIVE


# Where are the HTML tags in the render tree?


# The Module Dependency Tree


# Recap

Your React app is taking shape with many components being nested within each other. How does React keep track of your app’s component structure?
React, and many other UI libraries, model UI as a tree. Thinking of your app as a tree is useful for understanding the relationship between components. This understanding will help you debug future concepts like performance and state management.
How React “sees” component structures
What a render tree is and what it is useful for
What a module dependency tree is and what it is useful for
Trees are a relationship model between items and UI is often represented using tree structures. For example, browsers use tree structures to model HTML (DOM) and CSS (CSSOM). Mobile platforms also use trees to represent their view hierarchy.
React creates a UI tree from your components. In this example, the UI tree is then used to render to the DOM.
Like browsers and mobile platforms, React also uses tree structures to manage and model the relationship between components in a React app. These trees are useful tools to understand how data flows through a React app and how to optimize rendering and app size.
A major feature of components is the ability to compose components of other components. As we nest components, we have the concept of parent and child components, where each parent component may itself be a child of another component.
When we render a React app, we can model this relationship in a tree, known as the render tree.
Here is a React app that renders inspirational quotes.
React creates a render tree, a UI tree, composed of the rendered components.
From the example app, we can construct the above render tree.
The tree is composed of nodes, each of which represents a component. App, FancyText, Copyright, to name a few, are all nodes in our tree.
The root node in a React render tree is the root component of the app. In this case, the root component is App and it is the first component React renders. Each arrow in the tree points from a parent component to a child component.



A render tree represents a single render pass of a React application. With conditional rendering, a parent component may render different children depending on the data passed.
We can update the app to conditionally render either an inspirational quote or color.
With conditional rendering, across different renders, the render tree may render different components.
In this example, depending on what inspiration.type is, we may render <FancyText> or <Color>. The render tree may be different for each render pass.
Although render trees may differ across render passes, these trees are generally helpful for identifying what the top-level and leaf components are in a React app. Top-level components are the components nearest to the root component and affect the rendering performance of all the components beneath them and often contain the most complexity. Leaf components are near the bottom of the tree and have no child components and are often frequently re-rendered.
Identifying these categories of components are useful for understanding data flow and performance of your app.
Another relationship in a React app that can be modeled with a tree are an app’s module dependencies. As we break up our components and logic into separate files, we create JS modules where we may export components, functions, or constants.
Each node in a module dependency tree is a module and each branch represents an import statement in that module.
If we take the previous Inspirations app, we can build a module dependency tree, or dependency tree for short.
The module dependency tree for the Inspirations app.
The root node of the tree is the root module, also known as the entrypoint file. It often is the module that contains the root component.
Comparing to the render tree of the same app, there are similar structures but some notable differences:
The nodes that make-up the tree represent modules, not components.
Non-component modules, like inspirations.js, are also represented in this tree. The render tree only encapsulates components.
Copyright.js appears under App.js but in the render tree, Copyright, the component, appears as a child of InspirationGenerator. This is because InspirationGenerator accepts JSX as children props, so it renders Copyright as a child component but does not import the module.
Dependency trees are useful to determine what modules are necessary to run your React app. When building a React app for production, there is typically a build step that will bundle all the necessary JavaScript to ship to the client. The tool responsible for this is called a bundler, and bundlers will use the dependency tree to determine what modules should be included.
As your app grows, often the bundle size does too. Large bundle sizes are expensive for a client to download and run. Large bundle sizes can delay the time for your UI to get drawn. Getting a sense of your app’s dependency tree may help with debugging these issues.
Trees are a common way to represent the relationship between entities. They are often used to model UI.
Render trees represent the nested relationship between React components across a single render.
With conditional rendering, the render tree may change across different renders. With different prop values, components may render different children components.
Render trees help identify what the top-level and leaf components are. Top-level components affect the rendering performance of all components beneath them and leaf components are often re-rendered frequently. Identifying them is useful for understanding and debugging rendering performance.
Dependency trees represent the module dependencies in a React app.
Dependency trees are used by build tools to bundle the necessary code to ship an app.
Dependency trees are useful for debugging large bundle sizes that slow time to paint and expose opportunities for optimizing what code is bundled.""""""",1177,6153,react

Some things on the screen update in response to user input. For example, clicking an image gallery switches the active image. In React, data that changes over time is called state. You can add state to any component, and update it as needed. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to write components that handle interactions, update their state, and display different output over time.
How to handle user-initiated events
How to make components “remember” information with state
How React updates the UI in two phases
Why state doesn’t update right after you change it
How to queue multiple state updates
How to update an object in state
How to update an array in state
React lets you add event handlers to your JSX. Event handlers are your own functions that will be triggered in response to user interactions like clicking, hovering, focusing on form inputs, and so on.
Built-in components like <button> only support built-in browser events like onClick. However, you can also create your own components, and give their event handler props any application-specific names that you like.
Read Responding to Events to learn how to add event handlers.
Components often need to change what’s on the screen as a result of an interaction. Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking “next” on an image carousel should change which image is displayed, clicking “buy” puts a product in the shopping cart. Components need to “remember” things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. In React, this kind of component-specific memory is called state.
You can add state to a component with a useState Hook. Hooks are special functions that let your components use React features (state is one of those features). The useState Hook lets you declare a state variable. It takes the initial state and returns a pair of values: the current state, and a state setter function that lets you update it.
Here is how an image gallery uses and updates state on click:
Read State: A Component’s Memory to learn how to remember a value and update it on interaction.
Before your components are displayed on the screen, they must be rendered by React. Understanding the steps in this process will help you think about how your code executes and explain its behavior.
Imagine that your components are cooks in the kitchen, assembling tasty dishes from ingredients. In this scenario, React is the waiter who puts in requests from customers and brings them their orders. This process of requesting and serving UI has three steps:
Triggering a render (delivering the diner’s order to the kitchen)
Rendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)
Committing to the DOM (placing the order on the table)
Trigger
Render
Commit

Read Render and Commit to learn the lifecycle of a UI update.
Unlike regular JavaScript variables, React state behaves more like a snapshot. Setting it does not change the state variable you already have, but instead triggers a re-render. This can be surprising at first!
This behavior helps you avoid subtle bugs. Here is a little chat app. Try to guess what happens if you press “Send” first and then change the recipient to Bob. Whose name will appear in the alert five seconds later?
Read State as a Snapshot to learn why state appears “fixed” and unchanging inside the event handlers.
This component is buggy: clicking “+3” increments the score only once.
State as a Snapshot explains why this is happening. Setting state requests a new re-render, but does not change it in the already running code. So score continues to be 0 right after you call setScore(score + 1).
You can fix this by passing an updater function when setting state. Notice how replacing setScore(score + 1) with setScore(s => s + 1) fixes the “+3” button. This lets you queue multiple state updates.
Read Queueing a Series of State Updates to learn how to queue a sequence of state updates.
State can hold any kind of JavaScript value, including objects. But you shouldn’t change objects and arrays that you hold in the React state directly. Instead, when you want to update an object and array, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then update the state to use that copy.
Usually, you will use the ... spread syntax to copy objects and arrays that you want to change. For example, updating a nested object could look like this:
If copying objects in code gets tedious, you can use a library like Immer to reduce repetitive code:
Read Updating Objects in State to learn how to update objects correctly.
Arrays are another type of mutable JavaScript objects you can store in state and should treat as read-only. Just like with objects, when you want to update an array stored in state, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set state to use the new array:

# Challenge 1 of 2: Fix an event handler

React lets you add event handlers to your JSX. Event handlers are your own functions that will be triggered in response to interactions like clicking, hovering, focusing form inputs, and so on.
Different ways to write an event handler
How to pass event handling logic from a parent component
How events propagate and how to stop them
To add an event handler, you will first define a function and then pass it as a prop to the appropriate JSX tag. For example, here is a button that doesn’t do anything yet:
You can make it show a message when a user clicks by following these three steps:
Declare a function called handleClick inside your Button component.
Implement the logic inside that function (use alert to show the message).
Add onClick={handleClick} to the <button> JSX.
You defined the handleClick function and then passed it as a prop to <button>.  handleClick is an event handler. Event handler functions:
Are usually defined inside your components.
Have names that start with handle, followed by the name of the event.
By convention, it is common to name event handlers as handle followed by the event name. You’ll often see onClick={handleClick}, onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}, and so on.
Alternatively, you can define an event handler inline in the JSX:
Or, more concisely, using an arrow function:
All of these styles are equivalent. Inline event handlers are convenient for short functions.
Functions passed to event handlers must be passed, not called. For example:
The difference is subtle. In the first example, the handleClick function is passed as an onClick event handler. This tells React to remember it and only call your function when the user clicks the button.
In the second example, the () at the end of handleClick() fires the function immediately during rendering, without any clicks. This is because JavaScript inside the JSX { and } executes right away.
When you write code inline, the same pitfall presents itself in a different way:
Passing inline code like this won’t fire on click—it fires every time the component renders:
If you want to define your event handler inline, wrap it in an anonymous function like so:
Rather than executing the code inside with every render, this creates a function to be called later.
In both cases, what you want to pass is a function:
<button onClick={handleClick}> passes the handleClick function.
<button onClick={() => alert('...')}> passes the () => alert('...') function.
Read more about arrow functions.
Because event handlers are declared inside of a component, they have access to the component’s props. Here is a button that, when clicked, shows an alert with its message prop:
This lets these two buttons show different messages. Try changing the messages passed to them.
Often you’ll want the parent component to specify a child’s event handler. Consider buttons: depending on where you’re using a Button component, you might want to execute a different function—perhaps one plays a movie and another uploads an image.
To do this, pass a prop the component receives from its parent as the event handler like so:
Here, the Toolbar component renders a PlayButton and an UploadButton:
PlayButton passes handlePlayClick as the onClick prop to the Button inside.
UploadButton passes () => alert('Uploading!') as the onClick prop to the Button inside.
Finally, your Button component accepts a prop called onClick. It passes that prop directly to the built-in browser <button> with onClick={onClick}. This tells React to call the passed function on click.
If you use a design system, it’s common for components like buttons to contain styling but not specify behavior. Instead, components like PlayButton and UploadButton will pass event handlers down.
Built-in components like <button> and <div> only support browser event names like onClick. However, when you’re building your own components, you can name their event handler props any way that you like.
By convention, event handler props should start with on, followed by a capital letter.
For example, the Button component’s onClick prop could have been called onSmash:
In this example, <button onClick={onSmash}> shows that the browser <button> (lowercase) still needs a prop called onClick, but the prop name received by your custom Button component is up to you!
When your component supports multiple interactions, you might name event handler props for app-specific concepts. For example, this Toolbar component receives onPlayMovie and onUploadImage event handlers:
Notice how the App component does not need to know what Toolbar will do with onPlayMovie or onUploadImage. That’s an implementation detail of the Toolbar. Here, Toolbar passes them down as onClick handlers to its Buttons, but it could later also trigger them on a keyboard shortcut. Naming props after app-specific interactions like onPlayMovie gives you the flexibility to change how they’re used later.
Make sure that you use the appropriate HTML tags for your event handlers. For example, to handle clicks, use <button onClick={handleClick}> instead of <div onClick={handleClick}>. Using a real browser <button> enables built-in browser behaviors like keyboard navigation. If you don’t like the default browser styling of a button and want to make it look more like a link or a different UI element, you can achieve it with CSS. Learn more about writing accessible markup.
Event handlers will also catch events from any children your component might have. We say that an event “bubbles” or “propagates” up the tree: it starts with where the event happened, and then goes up the tree.
This <div> contains two buttons. Both the <div> and each button have their own onClick handlers. Which handlers do you think will fire when you click a button?
If you click on either button, its onClick will run first, followed by the parent <div>’s onClick. So two messages will appear. If you click the toolbar itself, only the parent <div>’s onClick will run.
All events propagate in React except onScroll, which only works on the JSX tag you attach it to.
Event handlers receive an event object as their only argument. By convention, it’s usually called e, which stands for “event”. You can use this object to read information about the event.
That event object also lets you stop the propagation. If you want to prevent an event from reaching parent components, you need to call e.stopPropagation() like this Button component does:
When you click on a button:
React calls the onClick handler passed to <button>.
That handler, defined in Button, does the following:
Calls e.stopPropagation(), preventing the event from bubbling further.
Calls the onClick function, which is a prop passed from the Toolbar component.
Calls e.stopPropagation(), preventing the event from bubbling further.
Calls the onClick function, which is a prop passed from the Toolbar component.
That function, defined in the Toolbar component, displays the button’s own alert.
Since the propagation was stopped, the parent <div>’s onClick handler does not run.
As a result of e.stopPropagation(), clicking on the buttons now only shows a single alert (from the <button>) rather than the two of them (from the <button> and the parent toolbar <div>). Clicking a button is not the same thing as clicking the surrounding toolbar, so stopping the propagation makes sense for this UI.






Notice how this click handler runs a line of code and then calls the onClick prop passed by the parent:
You could add more code to this handler before calling the parent onClick event handler, too. This pattern provides an alternative to propagation. It lets the child component handle the event, while also letting the parent component specify some additional behavior. Unlike propagation, it’s not automatic. But the benefit of this pattern is that you can clearly follow the whole chain of code that executes as a result of some event.
If you rely on propagation and it’s difficult to trace which handlers execute and why, try this approach instead.
Some browser events have default behavior associated with them. For example, a <form> submit event, which happens when a button inside of it is clicked, will reload the whole page by default:
You can call e.preventDefault() on the event object to stop this from happening:
Don’t confuse e.stopPropagation() and e.preventDefault(). They are both useful, but are unrelated:
e.stopPropagation() stops the event handlers attached to the tags above from firing.
e.preventDefault() prevents the default browser behavior for the few events that have it.
Absolutely! Event handlers are the best place for side effects.
Unlike rendering functions, event handlers don’t need to be pure, so it’s a great place to change something—for example, change an input’s value in response to typing, or change a list in response to a button press. However, in order to change some information, you first need some way to store it. In React, this is done by using state, a component’s memory. You will learn all about it on the next page.
You can handle events by passing a function as a prop to an element like <button>.
Event handlers must be passed, not called! onClick={handleClick}, not onClick={handleClick()}.
You can define an event handler function separately or inline.
Event handlers are defined inside a component, so they can access props.
You can declare an event handler in a parent and pass it as a prop to a child.
You can define your own event handler props with application-specific names.
Events propagate upwards. Call e.stopPropagation() on the first argument to prevent that.
Events may have unwanted default browser behavior. Call e.preventDefault() to prevent that.
Explicitly calling an event handler prop from a child handler is a good alternative to propagation.

Components often need to change what’s on the screen as a result of an interaction. Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking “next” on an image carousel should change which image is displayed, clicking “buy” should put a product in the shopping cart. Components need to “remember” things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. In React, this kind of component-specific memory is called state.
How to add a state variable with the useState Hook
What pair of values the useState Hook returns
How to add more than one state variable
Why state is called local
Here’s a component that renders a sculpture image. Clicking the “Next” button should show the next sculpture by changing the index to 1, then 2, and so on. However, this won’t work (you can try it!):
The handleClick event handler is updating a local variable, index. But two things prevent that change from being visible:
Local variables don’t persist between renders. When React renders this component a second time, it renders it from scratch—it doesn’t consider any changes to the local variables.
Changes to local variables won’t trigger renders. React doesn’t realize it needs to render the component again with the new data.
To update a component with new data, two things need to happen:
Retain the data between renders.
Trigger React to render the component with new data (re-rendering).
The useState Hook provides those two things:
A state variable to retain the data between renders.
A state setter function to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.
To add a state variable, import useState from React at the top of the file:
Then, replace this line:
with
index is a state variable and setIndex is the setter function.
The [ and ] syntax here is called array destructuring and it lets you read values from an array. The array returned by useState always has exactly two items.
This is how they work together in handleClick:
Now clicking the “Next” button switches the current sculpture:
In React, useState, as well as any other function starting with “use”, is called a Hook.
Hooks are special functions that are only available while React is rendering (which we’ll get into in more detail on the next page). They let you “hook into” different React features.
State is just one of those features, but you will meet the other Hooks later.
Hooks—functions starting with use—can only be called at the top level of your components or your own Hooks. You can’t call Hooks inside conditions, loops, or other nested functions. Hooks are functions, but it’s helpful to think of them as unconditional declarations about your component’s needs. You “use” React features at the top of your component similar to how you “import” modules at the top of your file.
When you call useState, you are telling React that you want this component to remember something:
In this case, you want React to remember index.
The convention is to name this pair like const [something, setSomething]. You could name it anything you like, but conventions make things easier to understand across projects.
The only argument to useState is the initial value of your state variable. In this example, the index’s initial value is set to 0 with useState(0).
Every time your component renders, useState gives you an array containing two values:
The state variable (index) with the value you stored.
The state setter function (setIndex) which can update the state variable and trigger React to render the component again.
Here’s how that happens in action:
Your component renders the first time. Because you passed 0 to useState as the initial value for index, it will return [0, setIndex]. React remembers 0 is the latest state value.
You update the state. When a user clicks the button, it calls setIndex(index + 1). index is 0, so it’s setIndex(1). This tells React to remember index is 1 now and triggers another render.
Your component’s second render. React still sees useState(0), but because React remembers that you set index to 1, it returns [1, setIndex] instead.
And so on!
You can have as many state variables of as many types as you like in one component. This component has two state variables, a number index and a boolean showMore that’s toggled when you click “Show details”:
It is a good idea to have multiple state variables if their state is unrelated, like index and showMore in this example. But if you find that you often change two state variables together, it might be easier to combine them into one. For example, if you have a form with many fields, it’s more convenient to have a single state variable that holds an object than state variable per field. Read Choosing the State Structure for more tips.





State is local to a component instance on the screen. In other words, if you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state! Changing one of them will not affect the other.
In this example, the Gallery component from earlier is rendered twice with no changes to its logic. Try clicking the buttons inside each of the galleries. Notice that their state is independent:
This is what makes state different from regular variables that you might declare at the top of your module. State is not tied to a particular function call or a place in the code, but it’s “local” to the specific place on the screen. You rendered two <Gallery /> components, so their state is stored separately.
Also notice how the Page component doesn’t “know” anything about the Gallery state or even whether it has any. Unlike props, state is fully private to the component declaring it. The parent component can’t change it. This lets you add state to any component or remove it without impacting the rest of the components.
What if you wanted both galleries to keep their states in sync? The right way to do it in React is to remove state from child components and add it to their closest shared parent. The next few pages will focus on organizing state of a single component, but we will return to this topic in Sharing State Between Components.
Use a state variable when a component needs to “remember” some information between renders.
State variables are declared by calling the useState Hook.
Hooks are special functions that start with use. They let you “hook into” React features like state.
Hooks might remind you of imports: they need to be called unconditionally. Calling Hooks, including useState, is only valid at the top level of a component or another Hook.
The useState Hook returns a pair of values: the current state and the function to update it.
You can have more than one state variable. Internally, React matches them up by their order.
State is private to the component. If you render it in two places, each copy gets its own state.
When you press “Next” on the last sculpture, the code crashes. Fix the logic to prevent the crash. You may do this by adding extra logic to event handler or by disabling the button when the action is not possible.
After fixing the crash, add a “Previous” button that shows the previous sculpture. It shouldn’t crash on the first sculpture.

```
import { useState } from 'react';
```


```
let index = 0;
```


```
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```


```
function handleClick() {
  setIndex(index + 1);
}
```


```
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

# Recap

Before your components are displayed on screen, they must be rendered by React. Understanding the steps in this process will help you think about how your code executes and explain its behavior.
What rendering means in React
When and why React renders a component
The steps involved in displaying a component on screen
Why rendering does not always produce a DOM update
Imagine that your components are cooks in the kitchen, assembling tasty dishes from ingredients. In this scenario, React is the waiter who puts in requests from customers and brings them their orders. This process of requesting and serving UI has three steps:
Triggering a render (delivering the guest’s order to the kitchen)
Rendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)
Committing to the DOM (placing the order on the table)
Trigger
Render
Commit

There are two reasons for a component to render:
It’s the component’s initial render.
The component’s (or one of its ancestors’) state has been updated.
When your app starts, you need to trigger the initial render. Frameworks and sandboxes sometimes hide this code, but it’s done by calling createRoot with the target DOM node, and then calling its render method with your component:
Try commenting out the root.render() call and see the component disappear!
Once the component has been initially rendered, you can trigger further renders by updating its state with the set function. Updating your component’s state automatically queues a render. (You can imagine these as a restaurant guest ordering tea, dessert, and all sorts of things after putting in their first order, depending on the state of their thirst or hunger.)
State update...
...triggers...
...render!

After you trigger a render, React calls your components to figure out what to display on screen. “Rendering” is React calling your components.
On initial render, React will call the root component.
For subsequent renders, React will call the function component whose state update triggered the render.
This process is recursive: if the updated component returns some other component, React will render that component next, and if that component also returns something, it will render that component next, and so on. The process will continue until there are no more nested components and React knows exactly what should be displayed on screen.
In the following example, React will call Gallery() and  Image() several times:
During the initial render, React will create the DOM nodes for <section>, <h1>, and three <img> tags.
During a re-render, React will calculate which of their properties, if any, have changed since the previous render. It won’t do anything with that information until the next step, the commit phase.
Rendering must always be a pure calculation:
Same inputs, same output. Given the same inputs, a component should always return the same JSX. (When someone orders a salad with tomatoes, they should not receive a salad with onions!)
It minds its own business. It should not change any objects or variables that existed before rendering. (One order should not change anyone else’s order.)
Otherwise, you can encounter confusing bugs and unpredictable behavior as your codebase grows in complexity. When developing in “Strict Mode”, React calls each component’s function twice, which can help surface mistakes caused by impure functions.

After rendering (calling) your components, React will modify the DOM.
For the initial render, React will use the appendChild() DOM API to put all the DOM nodes it has created on screen.
For re-renders, React will apply the minimal necessary operations (calculated while rendering!) to make the DOM match the latest rendering output.
React only changes the DOM nodes if there’s a difference between renders. For example, here is a component that re-renders with different props passed from its parent every second. Notice how you can add some text into the <input>, updating its value, but the text doesn’t disappear when the component re-renders:
This works because during this last step, React only updates the content of <h1> with the new time. It sees that the <input> appears in the JSX in the same place as last time, so React doesn’t touch the <input>—or its value!
After rendering is done and React updated the DOM, the browser will repaint the screen. Although this process is known as “browser rendering”, we’ll refer to it as “painting” to avoid confusion throughout the docs.

Any screen update in a React app happens in three steps:
Trigger
Render
Commit
Trigger
Render
Commit

# State as a Snapshot

# Setting state triggers renders


# Rendering takes a snapshot in time


# State over time


# Recap


# Try out some challenges


# Challenge 1 of 1: Implement a traffic light

State variables might look like regular JavaScript variables that you can read and write to. However, state behaves more like a snapshot. Setting it does not change the state variable you already have, but instead triggers a re-render.
How setting state triggers re-renders
When and how state updates
Why state does not update immediately after you set it
How event handlers access a “snapshot” of the state
You might think of your user interface as changing directly in response to the user event like a click. In React, it works a little differently from this mental model. On the previous page, you saw that setting state requests a re-render from React. This means that for an interface to react to the event, you need to update the state.
In this example, when you press “send”, setIsSent(true) tells React to re-render the UI:
Here’s what happens when you click the button:
The onSubmit event handler executes.
setIsSent(true) sets isSent to true and queues a new render.
React re-renders the component according to the new isSent value.
Let’s take a closer look at the relationship between state and rendering.
“Rendering” means that React is calling your component, which is a function. The JSX you return from that function is like a snapshot of the UI in time. Its props, event handlers, and local variables were all calculated using its state at the time of the render.
Unlike a photograph or a movie frame, the UI “snapshot” you return is interactive. It includes logic like event handlers that specify what happens in response to inputs. React updates the screen to match this snapshot and connects the event handlers. As a result, pressing a button will trigger the click handler from your JSX.
When React re-renders a component:
React calls your function again.
Your function returns a new JSX snapshot.
React then updates the screen to match the snapshot your function returned.
React executing the function
Calculating the snapshot
Updating the DOM tree

As a component’s memory, state is not like a regular variable that disappears after your function returns. State actually “lives” in React itself—as if on a shelf!—outside of your function. When React calls your component, it gives you a snapshot of the state for that particular render. Your component returns a snapshot of the UI with a fresh set of props and event handlers in its JSX, all calculated using the state values from that render!
You tell React to update the state
React updates the state value
React passes a snapshot of the state value into the component

Here’s a little experiment to show you how this works. In this example, you might expect that clicking the “+3” button would increment the counter three times because it calls setNumber(number + 1) three times.
See what happens when you click the “+3” button:
Notice that number only increments once per click!
Setting state only changes it for the next render. During the first render, number was 0. This is why, in that render’s onClick handler, the value of number is still 0 even after setNumber(number + 1) was called:
Here is what this button’s click handler tells React to do:
setNumber(number + 1): number is 0 so setNumber(0 + 1).
React prepares to change number to 1 on the next render.
React prepares to change number to 1 on the next render.
setNumber(number + 1): number is 0 so setNumber(0 + 1).
React prepares to change number to 1 on the next render.
React prepares to change number to 1 on the next render.
setNumber(number + 1): number is 0 so setNumber(0 + 1).
React prepares to change number to 1 on the next render.
React prepares to change number to 1 on the next render.
Even though you called setNumber(number + 1) three times, in this render’s event handler number is always 0, so you set the state to 1 three times. This is why, after your event handler finishes, React re-renders the component with number equal to 1 rather than 3.
You can also visualize this by mentally substituting state variables with their values in your code. Since the number state variable is 0 for this render, its event handler looks like this:
For the next render, number is 1, so that render’s click handler looks like this:
This is why clicking the button again will set the counter to 2, then to 3 on the next click, and so on.
Well, that was fun. Try to guess what clicking this button will alert:
If you use the substitution method from before, you can guess that the alert shows “0”:
But what if you put a timer on the alert, so it only fires after the component re-rendered? Would it say “0” or “5”? Have a guess!
Surprised? If you use the substitution method, you can see the “snapshot” of the state passed to the alert.
The state stored in React may have changed by the time the alert runs, but it was scheduled using a snapshot of the state at the time the user interacted with it!
A state variable’s value never changes within a render, even if its event handler’s code is asynchronous. Inside that render’s onClick, the value of number continues to be 0 even after setNumber(number + 5) was called. Its value was “fixed” when React “took the snapshot” of the UI by calling your component.
Here is an example of how that makes your event handlers less prone to timing mistakes. Below is a form that sends a message with a five-second delay. Imagine this scenario:
You press the “Send” button, sending “Hello” to Alice.
Before the five-second delay ends, you change the value of the “To” field to “Bob”.
What do you expect the alert to display? Would it display, “You said Hello to Alice”? Or would it display, “You said Hello to Bob”? Make a guess based on what you know, and then try it:
React keeps the state values “fixed” within one render’s event handlers. You don’t need to worry whether the state has changed while the code is running.
But what if you wanted to read the latest state before a re-render? You’ll want to use a state updater function, covered on the next page!
Setting state requests a new render.
React stores state outside of your component, as if on a shelf.
When you call useState, React gives you a snapshot of the state for that render.
Variables and event handlers don’t “survive” re-renders. Every render has its own event handlers.
Every render (and functions inside it) will always “see” the snapshot of the state that React gave to that render.
You can mentally substitute state in event handlers, similarly to how you think about the rendered JSX.
Event handlers created in the past have the state values from the render in which they were created.
Here is a crosswalk light component that toggles when the button is pressed:
Add an alert to the click handler. When the light is green and says “Walk”, clicking the button should say “Stop is next”. When the light is red and says “Stop”, clicking the button should say “Walk is next”.
Does it make a difference whether you put the alert before or after the setWalk call?

```
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(number + 1);
  setNumber(number + 1);
  setNumber(number + 1);
}}>+3</button>

<button onClick={() => {

# Challenge 1 of 2: Fix a request counter

Setting a state variable will queue another render. But sometimes you might want to perform multiple operations on the value before queueing the next render. To do this, it helps to understand how React batches state updates.
What “batching” is and how React uses it to process multiple state updates
How to apply several updates to the same state variable in a row
You might expect that clicking the “+3” button will increment the counter three times because it calls setNumber(number + 1) three times:
However, as you might recall from the previous section, each render’s state values are fixed, so the value of number inside the first render’s event handler is always 0, no matter how many times you call setNumber(1):
But there is one other factor at play here. React waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates. This is why the re-render only happens after all these setNumber() calls.
This might remind you of a waiter taking an order at the restaurant. A waiter doesn’t run to the kitchen at the mention of your first dish! Instead, they let you finish your order, let you make changes to it, and even take orders from other people at the table.

This lets you update multiple state variables—even from multiple components—without triggering too many re-renders. But this also means that the UI won’t be updated until after your event handler, and any code in it, completes. This behavior, also known as batching, makes your React app run much faster. It also avoids dealing with confusing “half-finished” renders where only some of the variables have been updated.
React does not batch across multiple intentional events like clicks—each click is handled separately. Rest assured that React only does batching when it’s generally safe to do. This ensures that, for example, if the first button click disables a form, the second click would not submit it again.
It is an uncommon use case, but if you would like to update the same state variable multiple times before the next render, instead of passing the next state value like setNumber(number + 1), you can pass a function that calculates the next state based on the previous one in the queue, like setNumber(n => n + 1). It is a way to tell React to “do something with the state value” instead of just replacing it.
Try incrementing the counter now:
Here, n => n + 1 is called an updater function. When you pass it to a state setter:
React queues this function to be processed after all the other code in the event handler has run.
During the next render, React goes through the queue and gives you the final updated state.
Here’s how React works through these lines of code while executing the event handler:
setNumber(n => n + 1): n => n + 1 is a function. React adds it to a queue.
setNumber(n => n + 1): n => n + 1 is a function. React adds it to a queue.
setNumber(n => n + 1): n => n + 1 is a function. React adds it to a queue.
When you call useState during the next render, React goes through the queue. The previous number state was 0, so that’s what React passes to the first updater function as the n argument. Then React takes the return value of your previous updater function and passes it to the next updater as n, and so on:
React stores 3 as the final result and returns it from useState.
This is why clicking “+3” in the above example correctly increments the value by 3.
What about this event handler? What do you think number will be in the next render?
Here’s what this event handler tells React to do:
setNumber(number + 5): number is 0, so setNumber(0 + 5). React adds “replace with 5” to its queue.
setNumber(n => n + 1): n => n + 1 is an updater function. React adds that function to its queue.
During the next render, React goes through the state queue:
React stores 6 as the final result and returns it from useState.
You may have noticed that setState(5) actually works like setState(n => 5), but n is unused!
Let’s try one more example. What do you think number will be in the next render?
Here’s how React works through these lines of code while executing this event handler:
setNumber(number + 5): number is 0, so setNumber(0 + 5). React adds “replace with 5” to its queue.
setNumber(n => n + 1): n => n + 1 is an updater function. React adds that function to its queue.
setNumber(42): React adds “replace with 42” to its queue.
During the next render, React goes through the state queue:
Then React stores 42 as the final result and returns it from useState.
To summarize, here’s how you can think of what you’re passing to the setNumber state setter:
An updater function (e.g. n => n + 1) gets added to the queue.
Any other value (e.g. number 5) adds “replace with 5” to the queue, ignoring what’s already queued.
After the event handler completes, React will trigger a re-render. During the re-render, React will process the queue. Updater functions run during rendering, so updater functions must be pure and only return the result. Don’t try to set state from inside of them or run other side effects. In Strict Mode, React will run each updater function twice (but discard the second result) to help you find mistakes.
It’s common to name the updater function argument by the first letters of the corresponding state variable:
If you prefer more verbose code, another common convention is to repeat the full state variable name, like setEnabled(enabled => !enabled), or to use a prefix like setEnabled(prevEnabled => !prevEnabled).
Setting state does not change the variable in the existing render, but it requests a new render.
React processes state updates after event handlers have finished running. This is called batching.
To update some state multiple times in one event, you can use setNumber(n => n + 1) updater function.
You’re working on an art marketplace app that lets the user submit multiple orders for an art item at the same time. Each time the user presses the “Buy” button, the “Pending” counter should increase by one. After three seconds, the “Pending” counter should decrease, and the “Completed” counter should increase.
However, the “Pending” counter does not behave as intended. When you press “Buy”, it decreases to -1 (which should not be possible!). And if you click fast twice, both counters seem to behave unpredictably.
Why does this happen? Fix both counters.

```
setNumber(0 + 1);
setNumber(0 + 1);
setNumber(0 + 1);

# Challenge 1 of 3: Fix incorrect state updates

State can hold any kind of JavaScript value, including objects. But you shouldn’t change objects that you hold in the React state directly. Instead, when you want to update an object, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set the state to use that copy.
How to correctly update an object in React state
How to update a nested object without mutating it
What immutability is, and how not to break it
How to make object copying less repetitive with Immer
You can store any kind of JavaScript value in state.
So far you’ve been working with numbers, strings, and booleans. These kinds of JavaScript values are “immutable”, meaning unchangeable or “read-only”. You can trigger a re-render to replace a value:
The x state changed from 0 to 5, but the number 0 itself did not change. It’s not possible to make any changes to the built-in primitive values like numbers, strings, and booleans in JavaScript.
Now consider an object in state:
Technically, it is possible to change the contents of the object itself. This is called a mutation:
However, although objects in React state are technically mutable, you should treat them as if they were immutable—like numbers, booleans, and strings. Instead of mutating them, you should always replace them.
In other words, you should treat any JavaScript object that you put into state as read-only.
This example holds an object in state to represent the current pointer position. The red dot is supposed to move when you touch or move the cursor over the preview area. But the dot stays in the initial position:
The problem is with this bit of code.
This code modifies the object assigned to position from the previous render. But without using the state setting function, React has no idea that object has changed. So React does not do anything in response. It’s like trying to change the order after you’ve already eaten the meal. While mutating state can work in some cases, we don’t recommend it. You should treat the state value you have access to in a render as read-only.
To actually trigger a re-render in this case, create a new object and pass it to the state setting function:
With setPosition, you’re telling React:
Replace position with this new object
And render this component again
Notice how the red dot now follows your pointer when you touch or hover over the preview area:




In the previous example, the position object is always created fresh from the current cursor position. But often, you will want to include existing data as a part of the new object you’re creating. For example, you may want to update only one field in a form, but keep the previous values for all other fields.
These input fields don’t work because the onChange handlers mutate the state:
For example, this line mutates the state from a past render:
The reliable way to get the behavior you’re looking for is to create a new object and pass it to setPerson. But here, you want to also copy the existing data into it because only one of the fields has changed:
You can use the ... object spread syntax so that you don’t need to copy every property separately.
Now the form works!
Notice how you didn’t declare a separate state variable for each input field. For large forms, keeping all data grouped in an object is very convenient—as long as you update it correctly!
Note that the ... spread syntax is “shallow”—it only copies things one level deep. This makes it fast, but it also means that if you want to update a nested property, you’ll have to use it more than once.


Consider a nested object structure like this:
If you wanted to update person.artwork.city, it’s clear how to do it with mutation:
But in React, you treat state as immutable! In order to change city, you would first need to produce the new artwork object (pre-populated with data from the previous one), and then produce the new person object which points at the new artwork:
Or, written as a single function call:
This gets a bit wordy, but it works fine for many cases:




If your state is deeply nested, you might want to consider flattening it. But, if you don’t want to change your state structure, you might prefer a shortcut to nested spreads. Immer is a popular library that lets you write using the convenient but mutating syntax and takes care of producing the copies for you. With Immer, the code you write looks like you are “breaking the rules” and mutating an object:
But unlike a regular mutation, it doesn’t overwrite the past state!

To try Immer:
Run npm install use-immer to add Immer as a dependency
Then replace import { useState } from 'react' with import { useImmer } from 'use-immer'
Here is the above example converted to Immer:
Notice how much more concise the event handlers have become. You can mix and match useState and useImmer in a single component as much as you like. Immer is a great way to keep the update handlers concise, especially if there’s nesting in your state, and copying objects leads to repetitive code.







Treat all state in React as immutable.
When you store objects in state, mutating them will not trigger renders and will change the state in previous render “snapshots”.
Instead of mutating an object, create a new version of it, and trigger a re-render by setting state to it.
You can use the {...obj, something: 'newValue'} object spread syntax to create copies of objects.
Spread syntax is shallow: it only copies one level deep.
To update a nested object, you need to create copies all the way up from the place you’re updating.
To reduce repetitive copying code, use Immer.
This form has a few bugs. Click the button that increases the score a few times. Notice that it does not increase. Then edit the first name, and notice that the score has suddenly “caught up” with your changes. Finally, edit the last name, and notice that the score has disappeared completely.
Your task is to fix all of these bugs. As you fix them, explain why each of them happens.

```
const [x, setX] = useState(0);
```


```
setX(5);

```
const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

Arrays are mutable in JavaScript, but you should treat them as immutable when you store them in state. Just like with objects, when you want to update an array stored in state, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set state to use the new array.
How to add, remove, or change items in an array in React state
How to update an object inside of an array
How to make array copying less repetitive with Immer
In JavaScript, arrays are just another kind of object. Like with objects, you should treat arrays in React state as read-only. This means that you shouldn’t reassign items inside an array like arr[0] = 'bird', and you also shouldn’t use methods that mutate the array, such as push() and pop().
Instead, every time you want to update an array, you’ll want to pass a new array to your state setting function. To do that, you can create a new array from the original array in your state by calling its non-mutating methods like filter() and map(). Then you can set your state to the resulting new array.
Here is a reference table of common array operations. When dealing with arrays inside React state, you will need to avoid the methods in the left column, and instead prefer the methods in the right column:
Alternatively, you can use Immer which lets you use methods from both columns.
Unfortunately, slice and splice are named similarly but are very different:
slice lets you copy an array or a part of it.
splice mutates the array (to insert or delete items).
In React, you will be using slice (no p!) a lot more often because you don’t want to mutate objects or arrays in state. Updating Objects explains what mutation is and why it’s not recommended for state.
push() will mutate an array, which you don’t want:
Instead, create a new array which contains the existing items and a new item at the end. There are multiple ways to do this, but the easiest one is to use the ... array spread syntax:
Now it works correctly:
The array spread syntax also lets you prepend an item by placing it before the original ...artists:
In this way, spread can do the job of both push() by adding to the end of an array and unshift() by adding to the beginning of an array. Try it in the sandbox above!
The easiest way to remove an item from an array is to filter it out. In other words, you will produce a new array that will not contain that item. To do this, use the filter method, for example:
Click the “Delete” button a few times, and look at its click handler.
Here, artists.filter(a => a.id !== artist.id) means “create an array that consists of those artists whose IDs are different from artist.id”. In other words, each artist’s “Delete” button will filter that artist out of the array, and then request a re-render with the resulting array. Note that filter does not modify the original array.
If you want to change some or all items of the array, you can use map() to create a new array. The function you will pass to map can decide what to do with each item, based on its data or its index (or both).
In this example, an array holds coordinates of two circles and a square. When you press the button, it moves only the circles down by 50 pixels. It does this by producing a new array of data using map():
It is particularly common to want to replace one or more items in an array. Assignments like arr[0] = 'bird' are mutating the original array, so instead you’ll want to use map for this as well.
To replace an item, create a new array with map. Inside your map call, you will receive the item index as the second argument. Use it to decide whether to return the original item (the first argument) or something else:
Sometimes, you may want to insert an item at a particular position that’s neither at the beginning nor at the end. To do this, you can use the ... array spread syntax together with the slice() method. The slice() method lets you cut a “slice” of the array. To insert an item, you will create an array that spreads the slice before the insertion point, then the new item, and then the rest of the original array.
In this example, the Insert button always inserts at the index 1:
There are some things you can’t do with the spread syntax and non-mutating methods like map() and filter() alone. For example, you may want to reverse or sort an array. The JavaScript reverse() and sort() methods are mutating the original array, so you can’t use them directly.
However, you can copy the array first, and then make changes to it.
For example:
Here, you use the [...list] spread syntax to create a copy of the original array first. Now that you have a copy, you can use mutating methods like nextList.reverse() or nextList.sort(), or even assign individual items with nextList[0] = ""something"".
However, even if you copy an array, you can’t mutate existing items inside of it directly. This is because copying is shallow—the new array will contain the same items as the original one. So if you modify an object inside the copied array, you are mutating the existing state. For example, code like this is a problem.
Although nextList and list are two different arrays, nextList[0] and list[0] point to the same object. So by changing nextList[0].seen, you are also changing list[0].seen. This is a state mutation, which you should avoid! You can solve this issue in a similar way to updating nested JavaScript objects—by copying individual items you want to change instead of mutating them. Here’s how.
Objects are not really located “inside” arrays. They might appear to be “inside” in code, but each object in an array is a separate value, to which the array “points”. This is why you need to be careful when changing nested fields like list[0]. Another person’s artwork list may point to the same element of the array!
When updating nested state, you need to create copies from the point where you want to update, and all the way up to the top level. Let’s see how this works.
In this example, two separate artwork lists have the same initial state. They are supposed to be isolated, but because of a mutation, their state is accidentally shared, and checking a box in one list affects the other list:
The problem is in code like this:
Although the myNextList array itself is new, the items themselves are the same as in the original myList array. So changing artwork.seen changes the original artwork item. That artwork item is also in yourList, which causes the bug. Bugs like this can be difficult to think about, but thankfully they disappear if you avoid mutating state.
You can use map to substitute an old item with its updated version without mutation.
Here, ... is the object spread syntax used to create a copy of an object.
With this approach, none of the existing state items are being mutated, and the bug is fixed:
In general, you should only mutate objects that you have just created. If you were inserting a new artwork, you could mutate it, but if you’re dealing with something that’s already in state, you need to make a copy.
Updating nested arrays without mutation can get a little bit repetitive. Just as with objects:
Generally, you shouldn’t need to update state more than a couple of levels deep. If your state objects are very deep, you might want to restructure them differently so that they are flat.
If you don’t want to change your state structure, you might prefer to use Immer, which lets you write using the convenient but mutating syntax and takes care of producing the copies for you.
Here is the Art Bucket List example rewritten with Immer:
Note how with Immer, mutation like artwork.seen = nextSeen is now okay:
This is because you’re not mutating the original state, but you’re mutating a special draft object provided by Immer. Similarly, you can apply mutating methods like push() and pop() to the content of the draft.
Behind the scenes, Immer always constructs the next state from scratch according to the changes that you’ve done to the draft. This keeps your event handlers very concise without ever mutating state.
You can put arrays into state, but you can’t change them.
Instead of mutating an array, create a new version of it, and update the state to it.
You can use the [...arr, newItem] array spread syntax to create arrays with new items.
You can use filter() and map() to create new arrays with filtered or transformed items.
You can use Immer to keep your code concise.
Fill in the handleIncreaseClick logic so that pressing ”+” increases the corresponding number:

```
setArtists( // Replace the state
  [ // with a new array
    ...artists, // that contains all the old items
    { id: nextId++, name: name } // and one new item at the end
  ]
);
```


```
setArtists([
  { id: nextId++, name: name },
  ...artists // Put old items at the end
]);
```


```
setArtists(
  artists.filter(a => a.id !== artist.id)
);
```


```
const nextList = [...list];
nextList[0].seen = true; // Problem: mutates list[0]
setList(nextList);
```


```
const myNextList = [...myList];
const artwork = myNextList.find(a => a.id === artworkId);
artwork.seen = nextSeen; // Problem: mutates an existing item
setMyList(myNextList);
```


```
setMyList(myList.map(artwork => {
  if (artwork.id === artworkId) {
    // Create a *new* object with changes
    return { ...artwork, seen: nextSeen };
  } else {
    // No changes
    return artwork;
  }
}));
```


```
updateMyTodos(draft => {
  const artwork = draft.find(a => a.id === artworkId);
  artwork.seen = nextSeen;
});

As your application grows, it helps to be more intentional about how your state is organized and how the data flows between your components. Redundant or duplicate state is a common source of bugs. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to structure your state well, how to keep your state update logic maintainable, and how to share state between distant components.
How to think about UI changes as state changes
How to structure state well
How to “lift state up” to share it between components
How to control whether the state gets preserved or reset
How to consolidate complex state logic in a function
How to pass information without “prop drilling”
How to scale state management as your app grows
With React, you won’t modify the UI from code directly. For example, you won’t write commands like “disable the button”, “enable the button”, “show the success message”, etc. Instead, you will describe the UI you want to see for the different visual states of your component (“initial state”, “typing state”, “success state”), and then trigger the state changes in response to user input. This is similar to how designers think about UI.
Here is a quiz form built using React. Note how it uses the status state variable to determine whether to enable or disable the submit button, and whether to show the success message instead.
Read Reacting to Input with State to learn how to approach interactions with a state-driven mindset.
Structuring state well can make a difference between a component that is pleasant to modify and debug, and one that is a constant source of bugs. The most important principle is that state shouldn’t contain redundant or duplicated information. If there’s unnecessary state, it’s easy to forget to update it, and introduce bugs!
For example, this form has a redundant fullName state variable:
You can remove it and simplify the code by calculating fullName while the component is rendering:
This might seem like a small change, but many bugs in React apps are fixed this way.
Read Choosing the State Structure to learn how to design the state shape to avoid bugs.
Sometimes, you want the state of two components to always change together. To do it, remove state from both of them, move it to their closest common parent, and then pass it down to them via props. This is known as “lifting state up”, and it’s one of the most common things you will do writing React code.
In this example, only one panel should be active at a time. To achieve this, instead of keeping the active state inside each individual panel, the parent component holds the state and specifies the props for its children.
Read Sharing State Between Components to learn how to lift state up and keep components in sync.
When you re-render a component, React needs to decide which parts of the tree to keep (and update), and which parts to discard or re-create from scratch. In most cases, React’s automatic behavior works well enough. By default, React preserves the parts of the tree that “match up” with the previously rendered component tree.
However, sometimes this is not what you want. In this chat app, typing a message and then switching the recipient does not reset the input. This can make the user accidentally send a message to the wrong person:
React lets you override the default behavior, and force a component to reset its state by passing it a different key, like <Chat key={email} />. This tells React that if the recipient is different, it should be considered a different Chat component that needs to be re-created from scratch with the new data (and UI like inputs). Now switching between the recipients resets the input field—even though you render the same component.
Read Preserving and Resetting State to learn the lifetime of state and how to control it.
Components with many state updates spread across many event handlers can get overwhelming. For these cases, you can consolidate all the state update logic outside your component in a single function, called “reducer”. Your event handlers become concise because they only specify the user “actions”. At the bottom of the file, the reducer function specifies how the state should update in response to each action!
Read Extracting State Logic into a Reducer to learn how to consolidate logic in the reducer function.
Usually, you will pass information from a parent component to a child component via props. But passing props can become inconvenient if you need to pass some prop through many components, or if many components need the same information. Context lets the parent component make some information available to any component in the tree below it—no matter how deep it is—without passing it explicitly through props.
Here, the Heading component determines its heading level by “asking” the closest Section for its level. Each Section tracks its own level by asking the parent Section and adding one to it. Every Section provides information to all components below it without passing props—it does that through context.
Read Passing Data Deeply with Context to learn about using context as an alternative to passing props.
Reducers let you consolidate a component’s state update logic. Context lets you pass information deep down to other components. You can combine reducers and context together to manage state of a complex screen.
With this approach, a parent component with complex state manages it with a reducer. Other components anywhere deep in the tree can read its state via context. They can also dispatch actions to update that state.
Read Scaling Up with Reducer and Context to learn how state management scales in a growing app.

React provides a declarative way to manipulate the UI. Instead of manipulating individual pieces of the UI directly, you describe the different states that your component can be in, and switch between them in response to the user input. This is similar to how designers think about the UI.
How declarative UI programming differs from imperative UI programming
How to enumerate the different visual states your component can be in
How to trigger the changes between the different visual states from code
When you design UI interactions, you probably think about how the UI changes in response to user actions. Consider a form that lets the user submit an answer:
When you type something into the form, the “Submit” button becomes enabled.
When you press “Submit”, both the form and the button become disabled, and a spinner appears.
If the network request succeeds, the form gets hidden, and the “Thank you” message appears.
If the network request fails, an error message appears, and the form becomes enabled again.
In imperative programming, the above corresponds directly to how you implement interaction. You have to write the exact instructions to manipulate the UI depending on what just happened. Here’s another way to think about this: imagine riding next to someone in a car and telling them turn by turn where to go.

They don’t know where you want to go, they just follow your commands. (And if you get the directions wrong, you end up in the wrong place!) It’s called imperative because you have to “command” each element, from the spinner to the button, telling the computer how to update the UI.
In this example of imperative UI programming, the form is built without React. It only uses the browser DOM:
Manipulating the UI imperatively works well enough for isolated examples, but it gets exponentially more difficult to manage in more complex systems. Imagine updating a page full of different forms like this one. Adding a new UI element or a new interaction would require carefully checking all existing code to make sure you haven’t introduced a bug (for example, forgetting to show or hide something).
React was built to solve this problem.
In React, you don’t directly manipulate the UI—meaning you don’t enable, disable, show, or hide components directly. Instead, you declare what you want to show, and React figures out how to update the UI. Think of getting into a taxi and telling the driver where you want to go instead of telling them exactly where to turn. It’s the driver’s job to get you there, and they might even know some shortcuts you haven’t considered!

You’ve seen how to implement a form imperatively above. To better understand how to think in React, you’ll walk through reimplementing this UI in React below:
Identify your component’s different visual states
Determine what triggers those state changes
Represent the state in memory using useState
Remove any non-essential state variables
Connect the event handlers to set the state
In computer science, you may hear about a “state machine” being in one of several “states”. If you work with a designer, you may have seen mockups for different “visual states”. React stands at the intersection of design and computer science, so both of these ideas are sources of inspiration.
First, you need to visualize all the different “states” of the UI the user might see:
Empty: Form has a disabled “Submit” button.
Typing: Form has an enabled “Submit” button.
Submitting: Form is completely disabled. Spinner is shown.
Success: “Thank you” message is shown instead of a form.
Error: Same as Typing state, but with an extra error message.
Just like a designer, you’ll want to “mock up” or create “mocks” for the different states before you add logic. For example, here is a mock for just the visual part of the form. This mock is controlled by a prop called status with a default value of 'empty':
You could call that prop anything you like, the naming is not important. Try editing status = 'empty' to status = 'success' to see the success message appear. Mocking lets you quickly iterate on the UI before you wire up any logic. Here is a more fleshed out prototype of the same component, still “controlled” by the status prop:


You can trigger state updates in response to two kinds of inputs:
Human inputs, like clicking a button, typing in a field, navigating a link.
Computer inputs, like a network response arriving, a timeout completing, an image loading.

In both cases, you must set state variables to update the UI. For the form you’re developing, you will need to change state in response to a few different inputs:
Changing the text input (human) should switch it from the Empty state to the Typing state or back, depending on whether the text box is empty or not.
Clicking the Submit button (human) should switch it to the Submitting state.
Successful network response (computer) should switch it to the Success state.
Failed network response (computer) should switch it to the Error state with the matching error message.
Notice that human inputs often require event handlers!
To help visualize this flow, try drawing each state on paper as a labeled circle, and each change between two states as an arrow. You can sketch out many flows this way and sort out bugs long before implementation.
Form states
Next you’ll need to represent the visual states of your component in memory with useState. Simplicity is key: each piece of state is a “moving piece”, and you want as few “moving pieces” as possible. More complexity leads to more bugs!
Start with the state that absolutely must be there. For example, you’ll need to store the answer for the input, and the error (if it exists) to store the last error:
Then, you’ll need a state variable representing which one of the visual states that you want to display. There’s usually more than a single way to represent that in memory, so you’ll need to experiment with it.
If you struggle to think of the best way immediately, start by adding enough state that you’re definitely sure that all the possible visual states are covered:
Your first idea likely won’t be the best, but that’s ok—refactoring state is a part of the process!
You want to avoid duplication in the state content so you’re only tracking what is essential. Spending a little time on refactoring your state structure will make your components easier to understand, reduce duplication, and avoid unintended meanings. Your goal is to prevent the cases where the state in memory doesn’t represent any valid UI that you’d want a user to see. (For example, you never want to show an error message and disable the input at the same time, or the user won’t be able to correct the error!)
Here are some questions you can ask about your state variables:
Does this state cause a paradox? For example, isTyping and isSubmitting can’t both be true. A paradox usually means that the state is not constrained enough. There are four possible combinations of two booleans, but only three correspond to valid states. To remove the “impossible” state, you can combine these into a status that must be one of three values: 'typing', 'submitting', or 'success'.
Is the same information available in another state variable already? Another paradox: isEmpty and isTyping can’t be true at the same time. By making them separate state variables, you risk them going out of sync and causing bugs. Fortunately, you can remove isEmpty and instead check answer.length === 0.
Can you get the same information from the inverse of another state variable? isError is not needed because you can check error !== null instead.
After this clean-up, you’re left with 3 (down from 7!) essential state variables:
You know they are essential, because you can’t remove any of them without breaking the functionality.

Lastly, create event handlers that update the state. Below is the final form, with all event handlers wired up:
Although this code is longer than the original imperative example, it is much less fragile. Expressing all interactions as state changes lets you later introduce new visual states without breaking existing ones. It also lets you change what should be displayed in each state without changing the logic of the interaction itself.
Declarative programming means describing the UI for each visual state rather than micromanaging the UI (imperative).
When developing a component:
Identify all its visual states.
Determine the human and computer triggers for state changes.
Model the state with useState.
Remove non-essential state to avoid bugs and paradoxes.
Connect the event handlers to set state.
Identify all its visual states.
Determine the human and computer triggers for state changes.
Model the state with useState.
Remove non-essential state to avoid bugs and paradoxes.
Connect the event handlers to set state.
Make it so that clicking on the picture removes the background--active CSS class from the outer <div>, but adds the picture--active class to the <img>. Clicking the background again should restore the original CSS classes.
Visually, you should expect that clicking on the picture removes the purple background and highlights the picture border. Clicking outside the picture highlights the background, but removes the picture border highlight.

# Challenge 1 of 4: Fix a component that’s not updating

Structuring state well can make a difference between a component that is pleasant to modify and debug, and one that is a constant source of bugs. Here are some tips you should consider when structuring state.
When to use a single vs multiple state variables
What to avoid when organizing state
How to fix common issues with the state structure
When you write a component that holds some state, you’ll have to make choices about how many state variables to use and what the shape of their data should be. While it’s possible to write correct programs even with a suboptimal state structure, there are a few principles that can guide you to make better choices:
Group related state. If you always update two or more state variables at the same time, consider merging them into a single state variable.
Avoid contradictions in state. When the state is structured in a way that several pieces of state may contradict and “disagree” with each other, you leave room for mistakes. Try to avoid this.
Avoid redundant state. If you can calculate some information from the component’s props or its existing state variables during rendering, you should not put that information into that component’s state.
Avoid duplication in state. When the same data is duplicated between multiple state variables, or within nested objects, it is difficult to keep them in sync. Reduce duplication when you can.
Avoid deeply nested state. Deeply hierarchical state is not very convenient to update. When possible, prefer to structure state in a flat way.
The goal behind these principles is to make state easy to update without introducing mistakes. Removing redundant and duplicate data from state helps ensure that all its pieces stay in sync. This is similar to how a database engineer might want to “normalize” the database structure to reduce the chance of bugs. To paraphrase Albert Einstein, “Make your state as simple as it can be—but no simpler.”
Now let’s see how these principles apply in action.
You might sometimes be unsure between using a single or multiple state variables.
Should you do this?
Or this?
Technically, you can use either of these approaches. But if some two state variables always change together, it might be a good idea to unify them into a single state variable. Then you won’t forget to always keep them in sync, like in this example where moving the cursor updates both coordinates of the red dot:
Another case where you’ll group data into an object or an array is when you don’t know how many pieces of state you’ll need. For example, it’s helpful when you have a form where the user can add custom fields.
If your state variable is an object, remember that you can’t update only one field in it without explicitly copying the other fields. For example, you can’t do setPosition({ x: 100 }) in the above example because it would not have the y property at all! Instead, if you wanted to set x alone, you would either do setPosition({ ...position, x: 100 }), or split them into two state variables and do setX(100).
Here is a hotel feedback form with isSending and isSent state variables:
While this code works, it leaves the door open for “impossible” states. For example, if you forget to call setIsSent and setIsSending together, you may end up in a situation where both isSending and isSent are true at the same time. The more complex your component is, the harder it is to understand what happened.
Since isSending and isSent should never be true at the same time, it is better to replace them with one status state variable that may take one of three valid states: 'typing' (initial), 'sending', and 'sent':
You can still declare some constants for readability:
But they’re not state variables, so you don’t need to worry about them getting out of sync with each other.
If you can calculate some information from the component’s props or its existing state variables during rendering, you should not put that information into that component’s state.
For example, take this form. It works, but can you find any redundant state in it?
This form has three state variables: firstName, lastName, and fullName. However, fullName is redundant. You can always calculate fullName from firstName and lastName during render, so remove it from state.
This is how you can do it:
Here, fullName is not a state variable. Instead, it’s calculated during render:
As a result, the change handlers don’t need to do anything special to update it. When you call setFirstName or setLastName, you trigger a re-render, and then the next fullName will be calculated from the fresh data.





This menu list component lets you choose a single travel snack out of several:
Currently, it stores the selected item as an object in the selectedItem state variable. However, this is not great: the contents of the selectedItem is the same object as one of the items inside the items list. This means that the information about the item itself is duplicated in two places.
Why is this a problem? Let’s make each item editable:
Notice how if you first click “Choose” on an item and then edit it, the input updates but the label at the bottom does not reflect the edits. This is because you have duplicated state, and you forgot to update selectedItem.
Although you could update selectedItem too, an easier fix is to remove duplication. In this example, instead of a selectedItem object (which creates a duplication with objects inside items), you hold the selectedId in state, and then get the selectedItem by searching the items array for an item with that ID:
The state used to be duplicated like this:
items = [{ id: 0, title: 'pretzels'}, ...]
selectedItem = {id: 0, title: 'pretzels'}
But after the change it’s like this:
items = [{ id: 0, title: 'pretzels'}, ...]
selectedId = 0
The duplication is gone, and you only keep the essential state!
Now if you edit the selected item, the message below will update immediately. This is because setItems triggers a re-render, and items.find(...) would find the item with the updated title. You didn’t need to hold the selected item in state, because only the selected ID is essential. The rest could be calculated during render.
Imagine a travel plan consisting of planets, continents, and countries. You might be tempted to structure its state using nested objects and arrays, like in this example:
Now let’s say you want to add a button to delete a place you’ve already visited. How would you go about it? Updating nested state involves making copies of objects all the way up from the part that changed. Deleting a deeply nested place would involve copying its entire parent place chain. Such code can be very verbose.
If the state is too nested to update easily, consider making it “flat”. Here is one way you can restructure this data. Instead of a tree-like structure where each place has an array of its child places, you can have each place hold an array of its child place IDs. Then store a mapping from each place ID to the corresponding place.
This data restructuring might remind you of seeing a database table:
Now that the state is “flat” (also known as “normalized”), updating nested items becomes easier.
In order to remove a place now, you only need to update two levels of state:
The updated version of its parent place should exclude the removed ID from its childIds array.
The updated version of the root “table” object should include the updated version of the parent place.
Here is an example of how you could go about it:
You can nest state as much as you like, but making it “flat” can solve numerous problems. It makes state easier to update, and it helps ensure you don’t have duplication in different parts of a nested object.

Sometimes, you can also reduce state nesting by moving some of the nested state into the child components. This works well for ephemeral UI state that doesn’t need to be stored, like whether an item is hovered.
If two state variables always update together, consider merging them into one.
Choose your state variables carefully to avoid creating “impossible” states.
Structure your state in a way that reduces the chances that you’ll make a mistake updating it.
Avoid redundant and duplicate state so that you don’t need to keep it in sync.
Don’t put props into state unless you specifically want to prevent updates.
For UI patterns like selection, keep ID or index in state instead of the object itself.
If updating deeply nested state is complicated, try flattening it.
This Clock component receives two props: color and time. When you select a different color in the select box, the Clock component receives a different color prop from its parent component. However, for some reason, the displayed color doesn’t update. Why? Fix the problem.

```
const [x, setX] = useState(0);
const [y, setY] = useState(0);
```


```
const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
```


```
const isSending = status === 'sending';
const isSent = status === 'sent';
```


```
const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
```


```

```


```

Sometimes, you want the state of two components to always change together. To do it, remove state from both of them, move it to their closest common parent, and then pass it down to them via props. This is known as lifting state up, and it’s one of the most common things you will do writing React code.
How to share state between components by lifting it up
What are controlled and uncontrolled components
In this example, a parent Accordion component renders two separate Panels:
Accordion
Panel
Panel
Panel
Panel
Each Panel component has a boolean isActive state that determines whether its content is visible.
Press the Show button for both panels:
Notice how pressing one panel’s button does not affect the other panel—they are independent.
Initially, each Panel’s isActive state is false, so they both appear collapsed
Clicking either Panel’s button will only update that Panel’s isActive state alone
But now let’s say you want to change it so that only one panel is expanded at any given time. With that design, expanding the second panel should collapse the first one. How would you do that?
To coordinate these two panels, you need to “lift their state up” to a parent component in three steps:
Remove state from the child components.
Pass hardcoded data from the common parent.
Add state to the common parent and pass it down together with the event handlers.
This will allow the Accordion component to coordinate both Panels and only expand one at a time.
You will give control of the Panel’s isActive to its parent component. This means that the parent component will pass isActive to Panel as a prop instead. Start by removing this line from the Panel component:
And instead, add isActive to the Panel’s list of props:
Now the Panel’s parent component can control isActive by passing it down as a prop. Conversely, the Panel component now has no control over the value of isActive—it’s now up to the parent component!
To lift state up, you must locate the closest common parent component of both of the child components that you want to coordinate:
Accordion (closest common parent)
Panel
Panel
Panel
Panel
In this example, it’s the Accordion component. Since it’s above both panels and can control their props, it will become the “source of truth” for which panel is currently active. Make the Accordion component pass a hardcoded value of isActive (for example, true) to both panels:
Try editing the hardcoded isActive values in the Accordion component and see the result on the screen.
Lifting state up often changes the nature of what you’re storing as state.
In this case, only one panel should be active at a time. This means that the Accordion common parent component needs to keep track of which panel is the active one. Instead of a boolean value, it could use a number as the index of the active Panel for the state variable:
When the activeIndex is 0, the first panel is active, and when it’s 1, it’s the second one.
Clicking the “Show” button in either Panel needs to change the active index in Accordion. A Panel can’t set the activeIndex state directly because it’s defined inside the Accordion. The Accordion component needs to explicitly allow the Panel component to change its state by passing an event handler down as a prop:
The <button> inside the Panel will now use the onShow prop as its click event handler:
This completes lifting state up! Moving state into the common parent component allowed you to coordinate the two panels. Using the active index instead of two “is shown” flags ensured that only one panel is active at a given time. And passing down the event handler to the child allowed the child to change the parent’s state.
Initially, Accordion’s activeIndex is 0, so the first Panel receives isActive = true
When Accordion’s activeIndex state changes to 1, the second Panel receives isActive = true instead





In a React application, many components will have their own state. Some state may “live” close to the leaf components (components at the bottom of the tree) like inputs. Other state may “live” closer to the top of the app. For example, even client-side routing libraries are usually implemented by storing the current route in the React state, and passing it down by props!
For each unique piece of state, you will choose the component that “owns” it. This principle is also known as having a “single source of truth”. It doesn’t mean that all state lives in one place—but that for each piece of state, there is a specific component that holds that piece of information. Instead of duplicating shared state between components, lift it up to their common shared parent, and pass it down to the children that need it.
Your app will change as you work on it. It is common that you will move state down or back up while you’re still figuring out where each piece of the state “lives”. This is all part of the process!
To see what this feels like in practice with a few more components, read Thinking in React.
When you want to coordinate two components, move their state to their common parent.
Then pass the information down through props from their common parent.
Finally, pass the event handlers down so that the children can change the parent’s state.
It’s useful to consider components as “controlled” (driven by props) or “uncontrolled” (driven by state).
These two inputs are independent. Make them stay in sync: editing one input should update the other input with the same text, and vice versa.

```
const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
```


```
function Panel({ title, children, isActive }) {
```


```
const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);
```


```
<>
  <Panel
    isActive={activeIndex === 0}
    onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)}
  >
    ...
  </Panel>
  <Panel
    isActive={activeIndex === 1}
    onShow={() => setActiveIndex(1)}
  >
    ...
  </Panel>
</>

State is isolated between components. React keeps track of which state belongs to which component based on their place in the UI tree. You can control when to preserve state and when to reset it between re-renders.
When React chooses to preserve or reset the state
How to force React to reset component’s state
How keys and types affect whether the state is preserved
React builds render trees for the component structure in your UI.
When you give a component state, you might think the state “lives” inside the component. But the state is actually held inside React. React associates each piece of state it’s holding with the correct component by where that component sits in the render tree.
Here, there is only one <Counter /> JSX tag, but it’s rendered at two different positions:
Here’s how these look as a tree:
React tree
These are two separate counters because each is rendered at its own position in the tree. You don’t usually have to think about these positions to use React, but it can be useful to understand how it works.
In React, each component on the screen has fully isolated state. For example, if you render two Counter components side by side, each of them will get its own, independent, score and hover states.
Try clicking both counters and notice they don’t affect each other:
As you can see, when one counter is updated, only the state for that component is updated:
Updating state
React will keep the state around for as long as you render the same component at the same position in the tree. To see this, increment both counters, then remove the second component by unchecking “Render the second counter” checkbox, and then add it back by ticking it again:
Notice how the moment you stop rendering the second counter, its state disappears completely. That’s because when React removes a component, it destroys its state.
Deleting a component
When you tick “Render the second counter”, a second Counter and its state are initialized from scratch (score = 0) and added to the DOM.
Adding a component
React preserves a component’s state for as long as it’s being rendered at its position in the UI tree. If it gets removed, or a different component gets rendered at the same position, React discards its state.
In this example, there are two different <Counter /> tags:
When you tick or clear the checkbox, the counter state does not get reset. Whether isFancy is true or false, you always have a <Counter /> as the first child of the div returned from the root App component:
Updating the App state does not reset the Counter because Counter stays in the same position
It’s the same component at the same position, so from React’s perspective, it’s the same counter.
Remember that it’s the position in the UI tree—not in the JSX markup—that matters to React! This component has two return clauses with different <Counter /> JSX tags inside and outside the if:
You might expect the state to reset when you tick checkbox, but it doesn’t! This is because both of these <Counter /> tags are rendered at the same position. React doesn’t know where you place the conditions in your function. All it “sees” is the tree you return.
In both cases, the App component returns a <div> with <Counter /> as a first child. To React, these two counters have the same “address”: the first child of the first child of the root. This is how React matches them up between the previous and next renders, regardless of how you structure your logic.
In this example, ticking the checkbox will replace <Counter> with a <p>:
Here, you switch between different component types at the same position. Initially, the first child of the <div> contained a Counter. But when you swapped in a p, React removed the Counter from the UI tree and destroyed its state.
When Counter changes to p, the Counter is deleted and the p is added
When switching back, the p is deleted and the Counter is added
Also, when you render a different component in the same position, it resets the state of its entire subtree. To see how this works, increment the counter and then tick the checkbox:
The counter state gets reset when you click the checkbox. Although you render a Counter, the first child of the div changes from a div to a section. When the child div was removed from the DOM, the whole tree below it (including the Counter and its state) was destroyed as well.
When section changes to div, the section is deleted and the new div is added
When switching back, the div is deleted and the new section is added
As a rule of thumb, if you want to preserve the state between re-renders, the structure of your tree needs to “match up” from one render to another. If the structure is different, the state gets destroyed because React destroys state when it removes a component from the tree.
This is why you should not nest component function definitions.
Here, the MyTextField component function is defined inside MyComponent:
Every time you click the button, the input state disappears! This is because a different MyTextField function is created for every render of MyComponent. You’re rendering a different component in the same position, so React resets all state below. This leads to bugs and performance problems. To avoid this problem, always declare component functions at the top level, and don’t nest their definitions.
By default, React preserves state of a component while it stays at the same position. Usually, this is exactly what you want, so it makes sense as the default behavior. But sometimes, you may want to reset a component’s state. Consider this app that lets two players keep track of their scores during each turn:
Currently, when you change the player, the score is preserved. The two Counters appear in the same position, so React sees them as the same Counter whose person prop has changed.
But conceptually, in this app they should be two separate counters. They might appear in the same place in the UI, but one is a counter for Taylor, and another is a counter for Sarah.
There are two ways to reset state when switching between them:
Render components in different positions
Give each component an explicit identity with key
If you want these two Counters to be independent, you can render them in two different positions:
Initially, isPlayerA is true. So the first position contains Counter state, and the second one is empty.
When you click the “Next player” button the first position clears but the second one now contains a Counter.
Initial state
Clicking “next”
Clicking “next” again
Each Counter’s state gets destroyed each time it’s removed from the DOM. This is why they reset every time you click the button.
This solution is convenient when you only have a few independent components rendered in the same place. In this example, you only have two, so it’s not a hassle to render both separately in the JSX.
There is also another, more generic, way to reset a component’s state.
You might have seen keys when rendering lists. Keys aren’t just for lists! You can use keys to make React distinguish between any components. By default, React uses order within the parent (“first counter”, “second counter”) to discern between components. But keys let you tell React that this is not just a first counter, or a second counter, but a specific counter—for example, Taylor’s counter. This way, React will know Taylor’s counter wherever it appears in the tree!
In this example, the two <Counter />s don’t share state even though they appear in the same place in JSX:
Switching between Taylor and Sarah does not preserve the state. This is because you gave them different keys:
Specifying a key tells React to use the key itself as part of the position, instead of their order within the parent. This is why, even though you render them in the same place in JSX, React sees them as two different counters, and so they will never share state. Every time a counter appears on the screen, its state is created. Every time it is removed, its state is destroyed. Toggling between them resets their state over and over.
Remember that keys are not globally unique. They only specify the position within the parent.
Resetting state with a key is particularly useful when dealing with forms.
In this chat app, the <Chat> component contains the text input state:
Try entering something into the input, and then press “Alice” or “Bob” to choose a different recipient. You will notice that the input state is preserved because the <Chat> is rendered at the same position in the tree.
In many apps, this may be the desired behavior, but not in a chat app! You don’t want to let the user send a message they already typed to a wrong person due to an accidental click. To fix it, add a key:
This ensures that when you select a different recipient, the Chat component will be recreated from scratch, including any state in the tree below it. React will also re-create the DOM elements instead of reusing them.
Now switching the recipient always clears the text field:





React keeps state for as long as the same component is rendered at the same position.
State is not kept in JSX tags. It’s associated with the tree position in which you put that JSX.
You can force a subtree to reset its state by giving it a different key.
Don’t nest component definitions, or you’ll reset state by accident.
This example shows a message when you press the button. However, pressing the button also accidentally resets the input. Why does this happen? Fix it so that pressing the button does not reset the input text.

```
{isPlayerA ? (
  <Counter key=""Taylor"" person=""Taylor"" />
) : (
  <Counter key=""Sarah"" person=""Sarah"" />
)}
```


```
<Chat key={to.id} contact={to} />
```

# Challenge 1 of 4: Dispatch actions from event handlers

Components with many state updates spread across many event handlers can get overwhelming. For these cases, you can consolidate all the state update logic outside your component in a single function, called a reducer.
What a reducer function is
How to refactor useState to useReducer
When to use a reducer
How to write one well
As your components grow in complexity, it can get harder to see at a glance all the different ways in which a component’s state gets updated. For example, the TaskApp component below holds an array of tasks in state and uses three different event handlers to add, remove, and edit tasks:
Each of its event handlers calls setTasks in order to update the state. As this component grows, so does the amount of state logic sprinkled throughout it. To reduce this complexity and keep all your logic in one easy-to-access place, you can move that state logic into a single function outside your component, called a “reducer”.
Reducers are a different way to handle state. You can migrate from useState to useReducer in three steps:
Move from setting state to dispatching actions.
Write a reducer function.
Use the reducer from your component.
Your event handlers currently specify what to do by setting state:
Remove all the state setting logic. What you are left with are three event handlers:
handleAddTask(text) is called when the user presses “Add”.
handleChangeTask(task) is called when the user toggles a task or presses “Save”.
handleDeleteTask(taskId) is called when the user presses “Delete”.
Managing state with reducers is slightly different from directly setting state. Instead of telling React “what to do” by setting state, you specify “what the user just did” by dispatching “actions” from your event handlers. (The state update logic will live elsewhere!) So instead of “setting tasks” via an event handler, you’re dispatching an “added/changed/deleted a task” action. This is more descriptive of the user’s intent.
The object you pass to dispatch is called an “action”:
It is a regular JavaScript object. You decide what to put in it, but generally it should contain the minimal information about what happened. (You will add the dispatch function itself in a later step.)
An action object can have any shape.
By convention, it is common to give it a string type that describes what happened, and pass any additional information in other fields. The type is specific to a component, so in this example either 'added' or 'added_task' would be fine. Choose a name that says what happened!
A reducer function is where you will put your state logic. It takes two arguments, the current state and the action object, and it returns the next state:
React will set the state to what you return from the reducer.
To move your state setting logic from your event handlers to a reducer function in this example, you will:
Declare the current state (tasks) as the first argument.
Declare the action object as the second argument.
Return the next state from the reducer (which React will set the state to).
Here is all the state setting logic migrated to a reducer function:
Because the reducer function takes state (tasks) as an argument, you can declare it outside of your component. This decreases the indentation level and can make your code easier to read.
The code above uses if/else statements, but it’s a convention to use switch statements inside reducers. The result is the same, but it can be easier to read switch statements at a glance.
We’ll be using them throughout the rest of this documentation like so:
We recommend wrapping each case block into the { and } curly braces so that variables declared inside of different cases don’t clash with each other. Also, a case should usually end with a return. If you forget to return, the code will “fall through” to the next case, which can lead to mistakes!
If you’re not yet comfortable with switch statements, using if/else is completely fine.





Finally, you need to hook up the tasksReducer to your component. Import the useReducer Hook from React:
Then you can replace useState:
with useReducer like so:
The useReducer Hook is similar to useState—you must pass it an initial state and it returns a stateful value and a way to set state (in this case, the dispatch function). But it’s a little different.
The useReducer Hook takes two arguments:
A reducer function
An initial state
And it returns:
A stateful value
A dispatch function (to “dispatch” user actions to the reducer)
Now it’s fully wired up! Here, the reducer is declared at the bottom of the component file:
If you want, you can even move the reducer to a different file:
Component logic can be easier to read when you separate concerns like this. Now the event handlers only specify what happened by dispatching actions, and the reducer function determines how the state updates in response to them.
Reducers are not without downsides! Here’s a few ways you can compare them:
Code size: Generally, with useState you have to write less code upfront. With useReducer, you have to write both a reducer function and dispatch actions. However, useReducer can help cut down on the code if many event handlers modify state in a similar way.
Readability: useState is very easy to read when the state updates are simple. When they get more complex, they can bloat your component’s code and make it difficult to scan. In this case, useReducer lets you cleanly separate the how of update logic from the what happened of event handlers.
Debugging: When you have a bug with useState, it can be difficult to tell where the state was set incorrectly, and why. With useReducer, you can add a console log into your reducer to see every state update, and why it happened (due to which action). If each action is correct, you’ll know that the mistake is in the reducer logic itself. However, you have to step through more code than with useState.
Testing: A reducer is a pure function that doesn’t depend on your component. This means that you can export and test it separately in isolation. While generally it’s best to test components in a more realistic environment, for complex state update logic it can be useful to assert that your reducer returns a particular state for a particular initial state and action.
Personal preference: Some people like reducers, others don’t. That’s okay. It’s a matter of preference. You can always convert between useState and useReducer back and forth: they are equivalent!
We recommend using a reducer if you often encounter bugs due to incorrect state updates in some component, and want to introduce more structure to its code. You don’t have to use reducers for everything: feel free to mix and match! You can even useState and useReducer in the same component.
Keep these two tips in mind when writing reducers:
Reducers must be pure. Similar to state updater functions, reducers run during rendering! (Actions are queued until the next render.) This means that reducers must be pure—same inputs always result in the same output. They should not send requests, schedule timeouts, or perform any side effects (operations that impact things outside the component). They should update objects and arrays without mutations.
Each action describes a single user interaction, even if that leads to multiple changes in the data. For example, if a user presses “Reset” on a form with five fields managed by a reducer, it makes more sense to dispatch one reset_form action rather than five separate set_field actions. If you log every action in a reducer, that log should be clear enough for you to reconstruct what interactions or responses happened in what order. This helps with debugging!
Just like with updating objects and arrays in regular state, you can use the Immer library to make reducers more concise. Here, useImmerReducer lets you mutate the state with push or arr[i] = assignment:
Reducers must be pure, so they shouldn’t mutate state. But Immer provides you with a special draft object which is safe to mutate. Under the hood, Immer will create a copy of your state with the changes you made to the draft. This is why reducers managed by useImmerReducer can mutate their first argument and don’t need to return state.
To convert from useState to useReducer:
Dispatch actions from event handlers.
Write a reducer function that returns the next state for a given state and action.
Replace useState with useReducer.
Dispatch actions from event handlers.
Write a reducer function that returns the next state for a given state and action.
Replace useState with useReducer.
Reducers require you to write a bit more code, but they help with debugging and testing.
Reducers must be pure.
Each action describes a single user interaction.
Use Immer if you want to write reducers in a mutating style.
Currently, the event handlers in ContactList.js and Chat.js have // TODO comments. This is why typing into the input doesn’t work, and clicking on the buttons doesn’t change the selected recipient.
Replace these two // TODOs with the code to dispatch the corresponding actions. To see the expected shape and the type of the actions, check the reducer in messengerReducer.js. The reducer is already written so you won’t need to change it. You only need to dispatch the actions in ContactList.js and Chat.js.

# Challenge 1 of 1: Replace prop drilling with context

Usually, you will pass information from a parent component to a child component via props. But passing props can become verbose and inconvenient if you have to pass them through many components in the middle, or if many components in your app need the same information. Context lets the parent component make some information available to any component in the tree below it—no matter how deep—without passing it explicitly through props.
What “prop drilling” is
How to replace repetitive prop passing with context
Common use cases for context
Common alternatives to context
Passing props is a great way to explicitly pipe data through your UI tree to the components that use it.
But passing props can become verbose and inconvenient when you need to pass some prop deeply through the tree, or if many components need the same prop. The nearest common ancestor could be far removed from the components that need data, and lifting state up that high can lead to a situation called “prop drilling”.
Lifting state up
Prop drilling
Wouldn’t it be great if there were a way to “teleport” data to the components in the tree that need it without passing props? With React’s context feature, there is!
Context lets a parent component provide data to the entire tree below it. There are many uses for context. Here is one example. Consider this Heading component that accepts a level for its size:
Let’s say you want multiple headings within the same Section to always have the same size:
Currently, you pass the level prop to each <Heading> separately:
It would be nice if you could pass the level prop to the <Section> component instead and remove it from the <Heading>. This way you could enforce that all headings in the same section have the same size:
But how can the <Heading> component know the level of its closest <Section>? That would require some way for a child to “ask” for data from somewhere above in the tree.
You can’t do it with props alone. This is where context comes into play. You will do it in three steps:
Create a context. (You can call it LevelContext, since it’s for the heading level.)
Use that context from the component that needs the data. (Heading will use LevelContext.)
Provide that context from the component that specifies the data. (Section will provide LevelContext.)
Context lets a parent—even a distant one!—provide some data to the entire tree inside of it.
Using context in close children
Using context in distant children
First, you need to create the context. You’ll need to export it from a file so that your components can use it:
The only argument to createContext is the default value. Here, 1 refers to the biggest heading level, but you could pass any kind of value (even an object). You will see the significance of the default value in the next step.
Import the useContext Hook from React and your context:
Currently, the Heading component reads level from props:
Instead, remove the level prop and read the value from the context you just imported, LevelContext:
useContext is a Hook. Just like useState and useReducer, you can only call a Hook immediately inside a React component (not inside loops or conditions). useContext tells React that the Heading component wants to read the LevelContext.
Now that the Heading component doesn’t have a level prop, you don’t need to pass the level prop to Heading in your JSX like this anymore:
Update the JSX so that it’s the Section that receives it instead:
As a reminder, this is the markup that you were trying to get working:
Notice this example doesn’t quite work, yet! All the headings have the same size because even though you’re using the context, you have not provided it yet. React doesn’t know where to get it!
If you don’t provide the context, React will use the default value you’ve specified in the previous step. In this example, you specified 1 as the argument to createContext, so useContext(LevelContext) returns 1, setting all those headings to <h1>. Let’s fix this problem by having each Section provide its own context.
The Section component currently renders its children:
Wrap them with a context provider to provide the LevelContext to them:
This tells React: “if any component inside this <Section> asks for LevelContext, give them this level.” The component will use the value of the nearest <LevelContext.Provider> in the UI tree above it.
It’s the same result as the original code, but you did not need to pass the level prop to each Heading component! Instead, it “figures out” its heading level by asking the closest Section above:
You pass a level prop to the <Section>.
Section wraps its children into <LevelContext.Provider value={level}>.
Heading asks the closest value of LevelContext above with useContext(LevelContext).
Currently, you still have to specify each section’s level manually:
Since context lets you read information from a component above, each Section could read the level from the Section above, and pass level + 1 down automatically. Here is how you could do it:
With this change, you don’t need to pass the level prop either to the <Section> or to the <Heading>:
Now both Heading and Section read the LevelContext to figure out how “deep” they are. And the Section wraps its children into the LevelContext to specify that anything inside of it is at a “deeper” level.
This example uses heading levels because they show visually how nested components can override context. But context is useful for many other use cases too. You can pass down any information needed by the entire subtree: the current color theme, the currently logged in user, and so on.
You can insert as many components as you like between the component that provides context and the one that uses it. This includes both built-in components like <div> and components you might build yourself.
In this example, the same Post component (with a dashed border) is rendered at two different nesting levels. Notice that the <Heading> inside of it gets its level automatically from the closest <Section>:
You didn’t do anything special for this to work. A Section specifies the context for the tree inside it, so you can insert a <Heading> anywhere, and it will have the correct size. Try it in the sandbox above!
Context lets you write components that “adapt to their surroundings” and display themselves differently depending on where (or, in other words, in which context) they are being rendered.
How context works might remind you of CSS property inheritance. In CSS, you can specify color: blue for a <div>, and any DOM node inside of it, no matter how deep, will inherit that color unless some other DOM node in the middle overrides it with color: green. Similarly, in React, the only way to override some context coming from above is to wrap children into a context provider with a different value.
In CSS, different properties like color and background-color don’t override each other. You can set all  <div>’s color to red without impacting background-color. Similarly, different React contexts don’t override each other. Each context that you make with createContext() is completely separate from other ones, and ties together components using and providing that particular context. One component may use or provide many different contexts without a problem.
Context is very tempting to use! However, this also means it’s too easy to overuse it. Just because you need to pass some props several levels deep doesn’t mean you should put that information into context.
Here’s a few alternatives you should consider before using context:
Start by passing props. If your components are not trivial, it’s not unusual to pass a dozen props down through a dozen components. It may feel like a slog, but it makes it very clear which components use which data! The person maintaining your code will be glad you’ve made the data flow explicit with props.
Extract components and pass JSX as children to them. If you pass some data through many layers of intermediate components that don’t use that data (and only pass it further down), this often means that you forgot to extract some components along the way. For example, maybe you pass data props like posts to visual components that don’t use them directly, like <Layout posts={posts} />. Instead, make Layout take children as a prop, and render <Layout><Posts posts={posts} /></Layout>. This reduces the number of layers between the component specifying the data and the one that needs it.
If neither of these approaches works well for you, consider context.
Theming: If your app lets the user change its appearance (e.g. dark mode), you can put a context provider at the top of your app, and use that context in components that need to adjust their visual look.
Current account: Many components might need to know the currently logged in user. Putting it in context makes it convenient to read it anywhere in the tree. Some apps also let you operate multiple accounts at the same time (e.g. to leave a comment as a different user). In those cases, it can be convenient to wrap a part of the UI into a nested provider with a different current account value.
Routing: Most routing solutions use context internally to hold the current route. This is how every link “knows” whether it’s active or not. If you build your own router, you might want to do it too.
Managing state: As your app grows, you might end up with a lot of state closer to the top of your app. Many distant components below may want to change it. It is common to use a reducer together with context to manage complex state and pass it down to distant components without too much hassle.
Context is not limited to static values. If you pass a different value on the next render, React will update all the components reading it below! This is why context is often used in combination with state.
In general, if some information is needed by distant components in different parts of the tree, it’s a good indication that context will help you.
Context lets a component provide some information to the entire tree below it.
To pass context:
Create and export it with export const MyContext = createContext(defaultValue).
Pass it to the useContext(MyContext) Hook to read it in any child component, no matter how deep.
Wrap children into <MyContext.Provider value={...}> to provide it from a parent.
Create and export it with export const MyContext = createContext(defaultValue).
Pass it to the useContext(MyContext) Hook to read it in any child component, no matter how deep.
Wrap children into <MyContext.Provider value={...}> to provide it from a parent.
Context passes through any components in the middle.
Context lets you write components that “adapt to their surroundings”.
Before you use context, try passing props or passing JSX as children.
In this example, toggling the checkbox changes the imageSize prop passed to each <PlaceImage>. The checkbox state is held in the top-level App component, but each <PlaceImage> needs to be aware of it.
Currently, App passes imageSize to List, which passes it to each Place, which passes it to the PlaceImage. Remove the imageSize prop, and instead pass it from the App component directly to PlaceImage.
You can declare context in Context.js.

```
<Section>
  <Heading level={3}>About</Heading>
  <Heading level={3}>Photos</Heading>
  <Heading level={3}>Videos</Heading>
</Section>
```

        {children}

Reducers let you consolidate a component’s state update logic. Context lets you pass information deep down to other components. You can combine reducers and context together to manage state of a complex screen.
How to combine a reducer with context
How to avoid passing state and dispatch through props
How to keep context and state logic in a separate file
In this example from the introduction to reducers, the state is managed by a reducer. The reducer function contains all of the state update logic and is declared at the bottom of this file:
A reducer helps keep the event handlers short and concise. However, as your app grows, you might run into another difficulty. Currently, the tasks state and the dispatch function are only available in the top-level TaskApp component. To let other components read the list of tasks or change it, you have to explicitly pass down the current state and the event handlers that change it as props.
For example, TaskApp passes a list of tasks and the event handlers to TaskList:
And TaskList passes the event handlers to Task:
In a small example like this, this works well, but if you have tens or hundreds of components in the middle, passing down all state and functions can be quite frustrating!
This is why, as an alternative to passing them through props, you might want to put both the tasks state and the dispatch function into context. This way, any component below TaskApp in the tree can read the tasks and dispatch actions without the repetitive “prop drilling”.
Here is how you can combine a reducer with context:
Create the context.
Put state and dispatch into context.
Use context anywhere in the tree.
The useReducer Hook returns the current tasks and the dispatch function that lets you update them:
To pass them down the tree, you will create two separate contexts:
TasksContext provides the current list of tasks.
TasksDispatchContext provides the function that lets components dispatch actions.
Export them from a separate file so that you can later import them from other files:
Here, you’re passing null as the default value to both contexts. The actual values will be provided by the TaskApp component.
Now you can import both contexts in your TaskApp component. Take the tasks and dispatch returned by useReducer() and provide them to the entire tree below:
For now, you pass the information both via props and in context:
In the next step, you will remove prop passing.
Now you don’t need to pass the list of tasks or the event handlers down the tree:
Instead, any component that needs the task list can read it from the TaskContext:
To update the task list, any component can read the dispatch function from context and call it:
The TaskApp component does not pass any event handlers down, and the TaskList does not pass any event handlers to the Task component either. Each component reads the context that it needs:
The state still “lives” in the top-level TaskApp component, managed with useReducer. But its tasks and dispatch are now available to every component below in the tree by importing and using these contexts.
You don’t have to do this, but you could further declutter the components by moving both reducer and context into a single file. Currently, TasksContext.js contains only two context declarations:
This file is about to get crowded! You’ll move the reducer into that same file. Then you’ll declare a new TasksProvider component in the same file. This component will tie all the pieces together:
It will manage the state with a reducer.
It will provide both contexts to components below.
It will take children as a prop so you can pass JSX to it.
This removes all the complexity and wiring from your TaskApp component:
You can also export functions that use the context from TasksContext.js:
When a component needs to read context, it can do it through these functions:
This doesn’t change the behavior in any way, but it lets you later split these contexts further or add some logic to these functions. Now all of the context and reducer wiring is in TasksContext.js. This keeps the components clean and uncluttered, focused on what they display rather than where they get the data:
You can think of TasksProvider as a part of the screen that knows how to deal with tasks, useTasks as a way to read them, and useTasksDispatch as a way to update them from any component below in the tree.
Functions like useTasks and useTasksDispatch are called Custom Hooks. Your function is considered a custom Hook if its name starts with use. This lets you use other Hooks, like useContext, inside it.
As your app grows, you may have many context-reducer pairs like this. This is a powerful way to scale your app and lift state up without too much work whenever you want to access the data deep in the tree.
You can combine reducer with context to let any component read and update state above it.
To provide state and the dispatch function to components below:
Create two contexts (for state and for dispatch functions).
Provide both contexts from the component that uses the reducer.
Use either context from components that need to read them.
Create two contexts (for state and for dispatch functions).
Provide both contexts from the component that uses the reducer.
Use either context from components that need to read them.
You can further declutter the components by moving all wiring into one file.
You can export a component like TasksProvider that provides context.
You can also export custom Hooks like useTasks and useTasksDispatch to read it.

Some of your components may need to control and synchronize with systems outside of React. For example, you might need to focus an input using the browser API, play and pause a video player implemented without React, or connect and listen to messages from a remote server. In this chapter, you’ll learn the escape hatches that let you “step outside” React and connect to external systems. Most of your application logic and data flow should not rely on these features.
How to “remember” information without re-rendering
How to access DOM elements managed by React
How to synchronize components with external systems
How to remove unnecessary Effects from your components
How an Effect’s lifecycle is different from a component’s
How to prevent some values from re-triggering Effects
How to make your Effect re-run less often
How to share logic between components
When you want a component to “remember” some information, but you don’t want that information to trigger new renders, you can use a ref:
Like state, refs are retained by React between re-renders. However, setting state re-renders a component. Changing a ref does not! You can access the current value of that ref through the ref.current property.
A ref is like a secret pocket of your component that React doesn’t track. For example, you can use refs to store timeout IDs, DOM elements, and other objects that don’t impact the component’s rendering output.
Read Referencing Values with Refs to learn how to use refs to remember information.
React automatically updates the DOM to match your render output, so your components won’t often need to manipulate it. However, sometimes you might need access to the DOM elements managed by React—for example, to focus a node, scroll to it, or measure its size and position. There is no built-in way to do those things in React, so you will need a ref to the DOM node. For example, clicking the button will focus the input using a ref:
Read Manipulating the DOM with Refs to learn how to access DOM elements managed by React.
Some components need to synchronize with external systems. For example, you might want to control a non-React component based on the React state, set up a server connection, or send an analytics log when a component appears on the screen. Unlike event handlers, which let you handle particular events, Effects let you run some code after rendering. Use them to synchronize your component with a system outside of React.
Press Play/Pause a few times and see how the video player stays synchronized to the isPlaying prop value:
Many Effects also “clean up” after themselves. For example, an Effect that sets up a connection to a chat server should return a cleanup function that tells React how to disconnect your component from that server:
In development, React will immediately run and clean up your Effect one extra time. This is why you see ""✅ Connecting..."" printed twice. This ensures that you don’t forget to implement the cleanup function.
Read Synchronizing with Effects to learn how to synchronize components with external systems.
Effects are an escape hatch from the React paradigm. They let you “step outside” of React and synchronize your components with some external system. If there is no external system involved (for example, if you want to update a component’s state when some props or state change), you shouldn’t need an Effect. Removing unnecessary Effects will make your code easier to follow, faster to run, and less error-prone.
There are two common cases in which you don’t need Effects:
You don’t need Effects to transform data for rendering.
You don’t need Effects to handle user events.
For example, you don’t need an Effect to adjust some state based on other state:
Instead, calculate as much as you can while rendering:
However, you do need Effects to synchronize with external systems.
Read You Might Not Need an Effect to learn how to remove unnecessary Effects.
Effects have a different lifecycle from components. Components may mount, update, or unmount. An Effect can only do two things: to start synchronizing something, and later to stop synchronizing it. This cycle can happen multiple times if your Effect depends on props and state that change over time.
This Effect depends on the value of the roomId prop. Props are reactive values, which means they can change on a re-render. Notice that the Effect re-synchronizes (and re-connects to the server) if roomId changes:
React provides a linter rule to check that you’ve specified your Effect’s dependencies correctly. If you forget to specify roomId in the list of dependencies in the above example, the linter will find that bug automatically.
Read Lifecycle of Reactive Events to learn how an Effect’s lifecycle is different from a component’s.
This section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React.
Event handlers only re-run when you perform the same interaction again. Unlike event handlers, Effects re-synchronize if any of the values they read, like props or state, are different than during last render. Sometimes, you want a mix of both behaviors: an Effect that re-runs in response to some values but not others.
All code inside Effects is reactive. It will run again if some reactive value it reads has changed due to a re-render. For example, this Effect will re-connect to the chat if either roomId or theme have changed:
This is not ideal. You want to re-connect to the chat only if the roomId has changed. Switching the theme shouldn’t re-connect to the chat! Move the code reading theme out of your Effect into an Effect Event:
Code inside Effect Events isn’t reactive, so changing the theme no longer makes your Effect re-connect.
Read Separating Events from Effects to learn how to prevent some values from re-triggering Effects.
When you write an Effect, the linter will verify that you’ve included every reactive value (like props and state) that the Effect reads in the list of your Effect’s dependencies. This ensures that your Effect remains synchronized with the latest props and state of your component. Unnecessary dependencies may cause your Effect to run too often, or even create an infinite loop. The way you remove them depends on the case.
For example, this Effect depends on the options object which gets re-created every time you edit the input:
You don’t want the chat to re-connect every time you start typing a message in that chat. To fix this problem, move creation of the options object inside the Effect so that the Effect only depends on the roomId string:
Notice that you didn’t start by editing the dependency list to remove the options dependency. That would be wrong. Instead, you changed the surrounding code so that the dependency became unnecessary. Think of the dependency list as a list of all the reactive values used by your Effect’s code. You don’t intentionally choose what to put on that list. The list describes your code. To change the dependency list, change the code.
Read Removing Effect Dependencies to learn how to make your Effect re-run less often.
React comes with built-in Hooks like useState, useContext, and useEffect. Sometimes, you’ll wish that there was a Hook for some more specific purpose: for example, to fetch data, to keep track of whether the user is online, or to connect to a chat room. To do this, you can create your own Hooks for your application’s needs.
In this example, the usePointerPosition custom Hook tracks the cursor position, while useDelayedValue custom Hook returns a value that’s “lagging behind” the value you passed by a certain number of milliseconds. Move the cursor over the sandbox preview area to see a moving trail of dots following the cursor:
You can create custom Hooks, compose them together, pass data between them, and reuse them between components. As your app grows, you will write fewer Effects by hand because you’ll be able to reuse custom Hooks you already wrote. There are also many excellent custom Hooks maintained by the React community.

When you want a component to “remember” some information, but you don’t want that information to trigger new renders, you can use a ref.
How to add a ref to your component
How to update a ref’s value
How refs are different from state
How to use refs safely
You can add a ref to your component by importing the useRef Hook from React:
Inside your component, call the useRef Hook and pass the initial value that you want to reference as the only argument. For example, here is a ref to the value 0:
useRef returns an object like this:

You can access the current value of that ref through the ref.current property. This value is intentionally mutable, meaning you can both read and write to it. It’s like a secret pocket of your component that React doesn’t track. (This is what makes it an “escape hatch” from React’s one-way data flow—more on that below!)
Here, a button will increment ref.current on every click:
The ref points to a number, but, like state, you could point to anything: a string, an object, or even a function. Unlike state, ref is a plain JavaScript object with the current property that you can read and modify.
Note that the component doesn’t re-render with every increment. Like state, refs are retained by React between re-renders. However, setting state re-renders a component. Changing a ref does not!
You can combine refs and state in a single component. For example, let’s make a stopwatch that the user can start or stop by pressing a button. In order to display how much time has passed since the user pressed “Start”, you will need to keep track of when the Start button was pressed and what the current time is. This information is used for rendering, so you’ll keep it in state:
When the user presses “Start”, you’ll use setInterval in order to update the time every 10 milliseconds:
When the “Stop” button is pressed, you need to cancel the existing interval so that it stops updating the now state variable. You can do this by calling clearInterval, but you need to give it the interval ID that was previously returned by the setInterval call when the user pressed Start. You need to keep the interval ID somewhere. Since the interval ID is not used for rendering, you can keep it in a ref:
When a piece of information is used for rendering, keep it in state. When a piece of information is only needed by event handlers and changing it doesn’t require a re-render, using a ref may be more efficient.
Perhaps you’re thinking refs seem less “strict” than state—you can mutate them instead of always having to use a state setting function, for instance. But in most cases, you’ll want to use state. Refs are an “escape hatch” you won’t need often. Here’s how state and refs compare:
Here is a counter button that’s implemented with state:
Because the count value is displayed, it makes sense to use a state value for it. When the counter’s value is set with setCount(), React re-renders the component and the screen updates to reflect the new count.
If you tried to implement this with a ref, React would never re-render the component, so you’d never see the count change! See how clicking this button does not update its text:
This is why reading ref.current during render leads to unreliable code. If you need that, use state instead.



Typically, you will use a ref when your component needs to “step outside” React and communicate with external APIs—often a browser API that won’t impact the appearance of the component. Here are a few of these rare situations:
Storing timeout IDs
Storing and manipulating DOM elements, which we cover on the next page
Storing other objects that aren’t necessary to calculate the JSX.
If your component needs to store some value, but it doesn’t impact the rendering logic, choose refs.
Following these principles will make your components more predictable:
Treat refs as an escape hatch. Refs are useful when you work with external systems or browser APIs. If much of your application logic and data flow relies on refs, you might want to rethink your approach.
Don’t read or write ref.current during rendering. If some information is needed during rendering, use state instead. Since React doesn’t know when ref.current changes, even reading it while rendering makes your component’s behavior difficult to predict. (The only exception to this is code like if (!ref.current) ref.current = new Thing() which only sets the ref once during the first render.)
Limitations of React state don’t apply to refs. For example, state acts like a snapshot for every render and doesn’t update synchronously. But when you mutate the current value of a ref, it changes immediately:
This is because the ref itself is a regular JavaScript object, and so it behaves like one.
You also don’t need to worry about avoiding mutation when you work with a ref. As long as the object you’re mutating isn’t used for rendering, React doesn’t care what you do with the ref or its contents.
You can point a ref to any value. However, the most common use case for a ref is to access a DOM element. For example, this is handy if you want to focus an input programmatically. When you pass a ref to a ref attribute in JSX, like <div ref={myRef}>, React will put the corresponding DOM element into myRef.current. Once the element is removed from the DOM, React will update myRef.current to be null. You can read more about this in Manipulating the DOM with Refs.
Refs are an escape hatch to hold onto values that aren’t used for rendering. You won’t need them often.
A ref is a plain JavaScript object with a single property called current, which you can read or set.
You can ask React to give you a ref by calling the useRef Hook.
Like state, refs let you retain information between re-renders of a component.
Unlike state, setting the ref’s current value does not trigger a re-render.
Don’t read or write ref.current during rendering. This makes your component hard to predict.
Type a message and click “Send”. You will notice there is a three second delay before you see the “Sent!” alert. During this delay, you can see an “Undo” button. Click it. This “Undo” button is supposed to stop the “Sent!” message from appearing. It does this by calling clearTimeout for the timeout ID saved during handleSend. However, even after “Undo” is clicked, the “Sent!” message still appears. Find why it doesn’t work, and fix it.

```
import { useRef } from 'react';
```


```
const ref = useRef(0);
```


```
{ 
  current: 0 // The value you passed to useRef
}
```


```
const [startTime, setStartTime] = useState(null);
const [now, setNow] = useState(null);
```


```

```


```
ref.current = 5;
console.log(ref.current); // 5

React automatically updates the DOM to match your render output, so your components won’t often need to manipulate it. However, sometimes you might need access to the DOM elements managed by React—for example, to focus a node, scroll to it, or measure its size and position. There is no built-in way to do those things in React, so you will need a ref to the DOM node.
How to access a DOM node managed by React with the ref attribute
How the ref JSX attribute relates to the useRef Hook
How to access another component’s DOM node
In which cases it’s safe to modify the DOM managed by React
To access a DOM node managed by React, first, import the useRef Hook:
Then, use it to declare a ref inside your component:
Finally, pass your ref as the ref attribute to the JSX tag for which you want to get the DOM node:
The useRef Hook returns an object with a single property called current. Initially, myRef.current will be null. When React creates a DOM node for this <div>, React will put a reference to this node into myRef.current. You can then access this DOM node from your event handlers and use the built-in browser APIs defined on it.
In this example, clicking the button will focus the input:
To implement this:
Declare inputRef with the useRef Hook.
Pass it as <input ref={inputRef}>. This tells React to put this <input>’s DOM node into inputRef.current.
In the handleClick function, read the input DOM node from inputRef.current and call focus() on it with inputRef.current.focus().
Pass the handleClick event handler to <button> with onClick.
While DOM manipulation is the most common use case for refs, the useRef Hook can be used for storing other things outside React, like timer IDs. Similarly to state, refs remain between renders. Refs are like state variables that don’t trigger re-renders when you set them. Read about refs in Referencing Values with Refs.
You can have more than a single ref in a component. In this example, there is a carousel of three images. Each button centers an image by calling the browser scrollIntoView() method on the corresponding DOM node:








When you put a ref on a built-in component that outputs a browser element like <input />, React will set that ref’s current property to the corresponding DOM node (such as the actual <input /> in the browser).
However, if you try to put a ref on your own component, like <MyInput />, by default you will get null. Here is an example demonstrating it. Notice how clicking the button does not focus the input:
To help you notice the issue, React also prints an error to the console:
This happens because by default React does not let a component access the DOM nodes of other components. Not even for its own children! This is intentional. Refs are an escape hatch that should be used sparingly. Manually manipulating another component’s DOM nodes makes your code even more fragile.
Instead, components that want to expose their DOM nodes have to opt in to that behavior. A component can specify that it “forwards” its ref to one of its children. Here’s how MyInput can use the forwardRef API:
This is how it works:
<MyInput ref={inputRef} /> tells React to put the corresponding DOM node into inputRef.current. However, it’s up to the MyInput component to opt into that—by default, it doesn’t.
The MyInput component is declared using forwardRef. This opts it into receiving the inputRef from above as the second ref argument which is declared after props.
MyInput itself passes the ref it received to the <input> inside of it.
Now clicking the button to focus the input works:
In design systems, it is a common pattern for low-level components like buttons, inputs, and so on, to forward their refs to their DOM nodes. On the other hand, high-level components like forms, lists, or page sections usually won’t expose their DOM nodes to avoid accidental dependencies on the DOM structure.


In React, every update is split in two phases:
During render, React calls your components to figure out what should be on the screen.
During commit, React applies changes to the DOM.
In general, you don’t want to access refs during rendering. That goes for refs holding DOM nodes as well. During the first render, the DOM nodes have not yet been created, so ref.current will be null. And during the rendering of updates, the DOM nodes haven’t been updated yet. So it’s too early to read them.
React sets ref.current during the commit. Before updating the DOM, React sets the affected ref.current values to null. After updating the DOM, React immediately sets them to the corresponding DOM nodes.
Usually, you will access refs from event handlers. If you want to do something with a ref, but there is no particular event to do it in, you might need an Effect. We will discuss Effects on the next pages.





Refs are an escape hatch. You should only use them when you have to “step outside React”. Common examples of this include managing focus, scroll position, or calling browser APIs that React does not expose.
If you stick to non-destructive actions like focusing and scrolling, you shouldn’t encounter any problems. However, if you try to modify the DOM manually, you can risk conflicting with the changes React is making.
To illustrate this problem, this example includes a welcome message and two buttons. The first button toggles its presence using conditional rendering and state, as you would usually do in React. The second button uses the remove() DOM API to forcefully remove it from the DOM outside of React’s control.
Try pressing “Toggle with setState” a few times. The message should disappear and appear again. Then press “Remove from the DOM”. This will forcefully remove it. Finally, press “Toggle with setState”:
After you’ve manually removed the DOM element, trying to use setState to show it again will lead to a crash. This is because you’ve changed the DOM, and React doesn’t know how to continue managing it correctly.
Avoid changing DOM nodes managed by React. Modifying, adding children to, or removing children from elements that are managed by React can lead to inconsistent visual results or crashes like above.
However, this doesn’t mean that you can’t do it at all. It requires caution. You can safely modify parts of the DOM that React has no reason to update. For example, if some <div> is always empty in the JSX, React won’t have a reason to touch its children list. Therefore, it is safe to manually add or remove elements there.
Refs are a generic concept, but most often you’ll use them to hold DOM elements.
You instruct React to put a DOM node into myRef.current by passing <div ref={myRef}>.
Usually, you will use refs for non-destructive actions like focusing, scrolling, or measuring DOM elements.
A component doesn’t expose its DOM nodes by default. You can opt into exposing a DOM node by using forwardRef and passing the second ref argument down to a specific node.
Avoid changing DOM nodes managed by React.
If you do modify DOM nodes managed by React, modify parts that React has no reason to update.
In this example, the button toggles a state variable to switch between a playing and a paused state. However, in order to actually play or pause the video, toggling state is not enough. You also need to call play() and pause() on the DOM element for the <video>. Add a ref to it, and make the button work.
For an extra challenge, keep the “Play” button in sync with whether the video is playing even if the user right-clicks the video and plays it using the built-in browser media controls. You might want to listen to onPlay and onPause on the video to do that.

```
import { useRef } from 'react';
```


```
const myRef = useRef(null);
```


```
<div ref={myRef}>
```


```
// You can use any browser APIs, for example:
myRef.current.scrollIntoView();
```


```

```


```

```


```

```


```
const MyInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return <input {...props} ref={ref} />;
});
```


```

```


```

Some components need to synchronize with external systems. For example, you might want to control a non-React component based on the React state, set up a server connection, or send an analytics log when a component appears on the screen. Effects let you run some code after rendering so that you can synchronize your component with some system outside of React.
What Effects are
How Effects are different from events
How to declare an Effect in your component
How to skip re-running an Effect unnecessarily
Why Effects run twice in development and how to fix them
Before getting to Effects, you need to be familiar with two types of logic inside React components:
Rendering code (introduced in Describing the UI) lives at the top level of your component. This is where you take the props and state, transform them, and return the JSX you want to see on the screen. Rendering code must be pure. Like a math formula, it should only calculate the result, but not do anything else.

This is where you take the props and state, transform them, and return the JSX you want to see on the screen. Rendering code must be pure. Like a math formula, it should only calculate the result, but not do anything else.
Event handlers (introduced in Adding Interactivity) are nested functions inside your components that do things rather than just calculate them. An event handler might update an input field, submit an HTTP POST request to buy a product, or navigate the user to another screen. Event handlers contain “side effects” (they change the program’s state) caused by a specific user action (for example, a button click or typing).
Event handlers (introduced in Adding Interactivity) are nested functions inside your components that do things rather than just calculate them. An event handler might update an input field, submit an HTTP POST request to buy a product, or navigate the user to another screen. Event handlers contain “side effects” (they change the program’s state) caused by a specific user action (for example, a button click or typing).
Sometimes this isn’t enough. Consider a ChatRoom component that must connect to the chat server whenever it’s visible on the screen. Connecting to a server is not a pure calculation (it’s a side effect) so it can’t happen during rendering. However, there is no single particular event like a click that causes ChatRoom to be displayed.
Effects let you specify side effects that are caused by rendering itself, rather than by a particular event. Sending a message in the chat is an event because it is directly caused by the user clicking a specific button. However, setting up a server connection is an Effect because it should happen no matter which interaction caused the component to appear. Effects run at the end of a commit after the screen updates. This is a good time to synchronize the React components with some external system (like network or a third-party library).
Here and later in this text, capitalized “Effect” refers to the React-specific definition above, i.e. a side effect caused by rendering. To refer to the broader programming concept, we’ll say “side effect”.
Don’t rush to add Effects to your components. Keep in mind that Effects are typically used to “step out” of your React code and synchronize with some external system. This includes browser APIs, third-party widgets, network, and so on. If your Effect only adjusts some state based on other state, you might not need an Effect.
To write an Effect, follow these three steps:
Declare an Effect. By default, your Effect will run after every commit.
Specify the Effect dependencies. Most Effects should only re-run when needed rather than after every render. For example, a fade-in animation should only trigger when a component appears. Connecting and disconnecting to a chat room should only happen when the component appears and disappears, or when the chat room changes. You will learn how to control this by specifying dependencies.
Add cleanup if needed. Some Effects need to specify how to stop, undo, or clean up whatever they were doing. For example, “connect” needs “disconnect”, “subscribe” needs “unsubscribe”, and “fetch” needs either “cancel” or “ignore”. You will learn how to do this by returning a cleanup function.
Let’s look at each of these steps in detail.
To declare an Effect in your component, import the useEffect Hook from React:
Then, call it at the top level of your component and put some code inside your Effect:
Every time your component renders, React will update the screen and then run the code inside useEffect. In other words, useEffect “delays” a piece of code from running until that render is reflected on the screen.
Let’s see how you can use an Effect to synchronize with an external system. Consider a <VideoPlayer> React component. It would be nice to control whether it’s playing or paused by passing an isPlaying prop to it:
Your custom VideoPlayer component renders the built-in browser <video> tag:
However, the browser <video> tag does not have an isPlaying prop. The only way to control it is to manually call the play() and pause() methods on the DOM element. You need to synchronize the value of isPlaying prop, which tells whether the video should currently be playing, with calls like play() and pause().
We’ll need to first get a ref to the <video> DOM node.
You might be tempted to try to call play() or pause() during rendering, but that isn’t correct:
The reason this code isn’t correct is that it tries to do something with the DOM node during rendering. In React, rendering should be a pure calculation of JSX and should not contain side effects like modifying the DOM.
Moreover, when VideoPlayer is called for the first time, its DOM does not exist yet! There isn’t a DOM node yet to call play() or pause() on, because React doesn’t know what DOM to create until you return the JSX.
The solution here is to wrap the side effect with useEffect to move it out of the rendering calculation:
By wrapping the DOM update in an Effect, you let React update the screen first. Then your Effect runs.
When your VideoPlayer component renders (either the first time or if it re-renders), a few things will happen. First, React will update the screen, ensuring the <video> tag is in the DOM with the right props. Then React will run your Effect. Finally, your Effect will call play() or pause() depending on the value of isPlaying.
Press Play/Pause multiple times and see how the video player stays synchronized to the isPlaying value:
In this example, the “external system” you synchronized to React state was the browser media API. You can use a similar approach to wrap legacy non-React code (like jQuery plugins) into declarative React components.
Note that controlling a video player is much more complex in practice. Calling play() may fail, the user might play or pause using the built-in browser controls, and so on. This example is very simplified and incomplete.
By default, Effects run after every render. This is why code like this will produce an infinite loop:
Effects run as a result of rendering. Setting state triggers rendering. Setting state immediately in an Effect is like plugging a power outlet into itself. The Effect runs, it sets the state, which causes a re-render, which causes the Effect to run, it sets the state again, this causes another re-render, and so on.
Effects should usually synchronize your components with an external system. If there’s no external system and you only want to adjust some state based on other state, you might not need an Effect.
By default, Effects run after every render. Often, this is not what you want:
Sometimes, it’s slow. Synchronizing with an external system is not always instant, so you might want to skip doing it unless it’s necessary. For example, you don’t want to reconnect to the chat server on every keystroke.
Sometimes, it’s wrong. For example, you don’t want to trigger a component fade-in animation on every keystroke. The animation should only play once when the component appears for the first time.
To demonstrate the issue, here is the previous example with a few console.log calls and a text input that updates the parent component’s state. Notice how typing causes the Effect to re-run:
You can tell React to skip unnecessarily re-running the Effect by specifying an array of dependencies as the second argument to the useEffect call. Start by adding an empty [] array to the above example on line 14:
You should see an error saying React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'isPlaying':
The problem is that the code inside of your Effect depends on the isPlaying prop to decide what to do, but this dependency was not explicitly declared. To fix this issue, add isPlaying to the dependency array:
Now all dependencies are declared, so there is no error. Specifying [isPlaying] as the dependency array tells React that it should skip re-running your Effect if isPlaying is the same as it was during the previous render. With this change, typing into the input doesn’t cause the Effect to re-run, but pressing Play/Pause does:
The dependency array can contain multiple dependencies. React will only skip re-running the Effect if all of the dependencies you specify have exactly the same values as they had during the previous render. React compares the dependency values using the Object.is comparison. See the useEffect reference for details.
Notice that you can’t “choose” your dependencies. You will get a lint error if the dependencies you specified don’t match what React expects based on the code inside your Effect. This helps catch many bugs in your code. If you don’t want some code to re-run, edit the Effect code itself to not “need” that dependency.
The behaviors without the dependency array and with an empty [] dependency array are different:
We’ll take a close look at what “mount” means in the next step.




Consider a different example. You’re writing a ChatRoom component that needs to connect to the chat server when it appears. You are given a createConnection() API that returns an object with connect() and disconnect() methods. How do you keep the component connected while it is displayed to the user?
Start by writing the Effect logic:
It would be slow to connect to the chat after every re-render, so you add the dependency array:
The code inside the Effect does not use any props or state, so your dependency array is [] (empty). This tells React to only run this code when the component “mounts”, i.e. appears on the screen for the first time.
Let’s try running this code:
This Effect only runs on mount, so you might expect ""✅ Connecting..."" to be printed once in the console. However, if you check the console, ""✅ Connecting..."" gets printed twice. Why does it happen?
Imagine the ChatRoom component is a part of a larger app with many different screens. The user starts their journey on the ChatRoom page. The component mounts and calls connection.connect(). Then imagine the user navigates to another screen—for example, to the Settings page. The ChatRoom component unmounts. Finally, the user clicks Back and ChatRoom mounts again. This would set up a second connection—but the first connection was never destroyed! As the user navigates across the app, the connections would keep piling up.
Bugs like this are easy to miss without extensive manual testing. To help you spot them quickly, in development React remounts every component once immediately after its initial mount.
Seeing the ""✅ Connecting..."" log twice helps you notice the real issue: your code doesn’t close the connection when the component unmounts.
To fix the issue, return a cleanup function from your Effect:
React will call your cleanup function each time before the Effect runs again, and one final time when the component unmounts (gets removed). Let’s see what happens when the cleanup function is implemented:
Now you get three console logs in development:
""✅ Connecting...""
""❌ Disconnected.""
""✅ Connecting...""
This is the correct behavior in development. By remounting your component, React verifies that navigating away and back would not break your code. Disconnecting and then connecting again is exactly what should happen! When you implement the cleanup well, there should be no user-visible difference between running the Effect once vs running it, cleaning it up, and running it again. There’s an extra connect/disconnect call pair because React is probing your code for bugs in development. This is normal—don’t try to make it go away!
In production, you would only see ""✅ Connecting..."" printed once. Remounting components only happens in development to help you find Effects that need cleanup. You can turn off Strict Mode to opt out of the development behavior, but we recommend keeping it on. This lets you find many bugs like the one above.
React intentionally remounts your components in development to find bugs like in the last example. The right question isn’t “how to run an Effect once”, but “how to fix my Effect so that it works after remounting”.
Usually, the answer is to implement the cleanup function.  The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the Effect was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn’t be able to distinguish between the Effect running once (as in production) and a setup → cleanup → setup sequence (as you’d see in development).
Most of the Effects you’ll write will fit into one of the common patterns below.
A common pitfall for preventing Effects firing twice in development is to use a ref to prevent the Effect from running more than once. For example, you could “fix” the above bug with a useRef:
This makes it so you only see ""✅ Connecting..."" once in development, but it doesn’t fix the bug.
When the user navigates away, the connection still isn’t closed and when they navigate back, a new connection is created. As the user navigates across the app, the connections would keep piling up, the same as it would before the “fix”.
To fix the bug, it is not enough to just make the Effect run once. The effect needs to work after re-mounting, which means the connection needs to be cleaned up like in the solution above.
See the examples below for how to handle common patterns.
Sometimes you need to add UI widgets that aren’t written in React. For example, let’s say you’re adding a map component to your page. It has a setZoomLevel() method, and you’d like to keep the zoom level in sync with a zoomLevel state variable in your React code. Your Effect would look similar to this:
Note that there is no cleanup needed in this case. In development, React will call the Effect twice, but this is not a problem because calling setZoomLevel twice with the same value does not do anything. It may be slightly slower, but this doesn’t matter because it won’t remount needlessly in production.
Some APIs may not allow you to call them twice in a row. For example, the showModal method of the built-in <dialog> element throws if you call it twice. Implement the cleanup function and make it close the dialog:
In development, your Effect will call showModal(), then immediately close(), and then showModal() again. This has the same user-visible behavior as calling showModal() once, as you would see in production.
If your Effect subscribes to something, the cleanup function should unsubscribe:
In development, your Effect will call addEventListener(), then immediately removeEventListener(), and then addEventListener() again with the same handler. So there would be only one active subscription at a time. This has the same user-visible behavior as calling addEventListener() once, as in production.
If your Effect animates something in, the cleanup function should reset the animation to the initial values:
In development, opacity will be set to 1, then to 0, and then to 1 again. This should have the same user-visible behavior as setting it to 1 directly, which is what would happen in production. If you use a third-party animation library with support for tweening, your cleanup function should reset the timeline to its initial state.
If your Effect fetches something, the cleanup function should either abort the fetch or ignore its result:
You can’t “undo” a network request that already happened, but your cleanup function should ensure that the fetch that’s not relevant anymore does not keep affecting your application. If the userId changes from 'Alice' to 'Bob', cleanup ensures that the 'Alice' response is ignored even if it arrives after 'Bob'.
In development, you will see two fetches in the Network tab. There is nothing wrong with that. With the approach above, the first Effect will immediately get cleaned up so its copy of the ignore variable will be set to true. So even though there is an extra request, it won’t affect the state thanks to the if (!ignore) check.
In production, there will only be one request. If the second request in development is bothering you, the best approach is to use a solution that deduplicates requests and caches their responses between components:
This will not only improve the development experience, but also make your application feel faster. For example, the user pressing the Back button won’t have to wait for some data to load again because it will be cached. You can either build such a cache yourself or use one of the many alternatives to manual fetching in Effects.









Consider this code that sends an analytics event on the page visit:
In development, logVisit will be called twice for every URL, so you might be tempted to try to fix that. We recommend keeping this code as is. Like with earlier examples, there is no user-visible behavior difference between running it once and running it twice. From a practical point of view, logVisit should not do anything in development because you don’t want the logs from the development machines to skew the production metrics. Your component remounts every time you save its file, so it logs extra visits in development anyway.
In production, there will be no duplicate visit logs.
To debug the analytics events you’re sending, you can deploy your app to a staging environment (which runs in production mode) or temporarily opt out of Strict Mode and its development-only remounting checks. You may also send analytics from the route change event handlers instead of Effects. For more precise analytics, intersection observers can help track which components are in the viewport and how long they remain visible.
Some logic should only run once when the application starts. You can put it outside your components:
This guarantees that such logic only runs once after the browser loads the page.
Sometimes, even if you write a cleanup function, there’s no way to prevent user-visible consequences of running the Effect twice. For example, maybe your Effect sends a POST request like buying a product:
You wouldn’t want to buy the product twice. However, this is also why you shouldn’t put this logic in an Effect. What if the user goes to another page and then presses Back? Your Effect would run again. You don’t want to buy the product when the user visits a page; you want to buy it when the user clicks the Buy button.
Buying is not caused by rendering; it’s caused by a specific interaction. It should run only when the user presses the button. Delete the Effect and move your /api/buy request into the Buy button event handler:
This illustrates that if remounting breaks the logic of your application, this usually uncovers existing bugs. From a user’s perspective, visiting a page shouldn’t be different from visiting it, clicking a link, then pressing Back to view the page again. React verifies that your components abide by this principle by remounting them once in development.
This playground can help you “get a feel” for how Effects work in practice.
This example uses setTimeout to schedule a console log with the input text to appear three seconds after the Effect runs. The cleanup function cancels the pending timeout. Start by pressing “Mount the component”:
You will see three logs at first: Schedule ""a"" log, Cancel ""a"" log, and Schedule ""a"" log again. Three second later there will also be a log saying a. As you learned earlier, the extra schedule/cancel pair is because React remounts the component once in development to verify that you’ve implemented cleanup well.
Now edit the input to say abc. If you do it fast enough, you’ll see Schedule ""ab"" log immediately followed by Cancel ""ab"" log and Schedule ""abc"" log. React always cleans up the previous render’s Effect before the next render’s Effect. This is why even if you type into the input fast, there is at most one timeout scheduled at a time. Edit the input a few times and watch the console to get a feel for how Effects get cleaned up.
Type something into the input and then immediately press “Unmount the component”. Notice how unmounting cleans up the last render’s Effect. Here, it clears the last timeout before it has a chance to fire.
Finally, edit the component above and comment out the cleanup function so that the timeouts don’t get cancelled. Try typing abcde fast. What do you expect to happen in three seconds? Will console.log(text) inside the timeout print the latest text and produce five abcde logs? Give it a try to check your intuition!
Three seconds later, you should see a sequence of logs (a, ab, abc, abcd, and abcde) rather than five abcde logs. Each Effect “captures” the text value from its corresponding render.  It doesn’t matter that the text state changed: an Effect from the render with text = 'ab' will always see 'ab'. In other words, Effects from each render are isolated from each other. If you’re curious how this works, you can read about closures.

















Unlike events, Effects are caused by rendering itself rather than a particular interaction.
Effects let you synchronize a component with some external system (third-party API, network, etc).
By default, Effects run after every render (including the initial one).
React will skip the Effect if all of its dependencies have the same values as during the last render.
You can’t “choose” your dependencies. They are determined by the code inside the Effect.
Empty dependency array ([]) corresponds to the component “mounting”, i.e. being added to the screen.
In Strict Mode, React mounts components twice (in development only!) to stress-test your Effects.
If your Effect breaks because of remounting, you need to implement a cleanup function.
React will call your cleanup function before the Effect runs next time, and during the unmount.
In this example, the form renders a <MyInput /> component.
Use the input’s focus() method to make MyInput automatically focus when it appears on the screen. There is already a commented out implementation, but it doesn’t quite work. Figure out why it doesn’t work, and fix it. (If you’re familiar with the autoFocus attribute, pretend that it does not exist: we are reimplementing the same functionality from scratch.)
To verify that your solution works, press “Show form” and verify that the input receives focus (becomes highlighted and the cursor is placed inside). Press “Hide form” and “Show form” again. Verify the input is highlighted again.
MyInput should only focus on mount rather than after every render. To verify that the behavior is right, press “Show form” and then repeatedly press the “Make it uppercase” checkbox. Clicking the checkbox should not focus the input above it.

# Challenge 1 of 4: Transform data without Effects

Effects are an escape hatch from the React paradigm. They let you “step outside” of React and synchronize your components with some external system like a non-React widget, network, or the browser DOM. If there is no external system involved (for example, if you want to update a component’s state when some props or state change), you shouldn’t need an Effect. Removing unnecessary Effects will make your code easier to follow, faster to run, and less error-prone.
Why and how to remove unnecessary Effects from your components
How to cache expensive computations without Effects
How to reset and adjust component state without Effects
How to share logic between event handlers
Which logic should be moved to event handlers
How to notify parent components about changes
There are two common cases in which you don’t need Effects:
You don’t need Effects to transform data for rendering. For example, let’s say you want to filter a list before displaying it. You might feel tempted to write an Effect that updates a state variable when the list changes. However, this is inefficient. When you update the state, React will first call your component functions to calculate what should be on the screen. Then React will “commit” these changes to the DOM, updating the screen. Then React will run your Effects. If your Effect also immediately updates the state, this restarts the whole process from scratch! To avoid the unnecessary render passes, transform all the data at the top level of your components. That code will automatically re-run whenever your props or state change.
You don’t need Effects to handle user events. For example, let’s say you want to send an /api/buy POST request and show a notification when the user buys a product. In the Buy button click event handler, you know exactly what happened. By the time an Effect runs, you don’t know what the user did (for example, which button was clicked). This is why you’ll usually handle user events in the corresponding event handlers.
You do need Effects to synchronize with external systems. For example, you can write an Effect that keeps a jQuery widget synchronized with the React state. You can also fetch data with Effects: for example, you can synchronize the search results with the current search query. Keep in mind that modern frameworks provide more efficient built-in data fetching mechanisms than writing Effects directly in your components.
To help you gain the right intuition, let’s look at some common concrete examples!
Suppose you have a component with two state variables: firstName and lastName. You want to calculate a fullName from them by concatenating them. Moreover, you’d like fullName to update whenever firstName or lastName change. Your first instinct might be to add a fullName state variable and update it in an Effect:
This is more complicated than necessary. It is inefficient too: it does an entire render pass with a stale value for fullName, then immediately re-renders with the updated value. Remove the state variable and the Effect:
When something can be calculated from the existing props or state, don’t put it in state. Instead, calculate it during rendering. This makes your code faster (you avoid the extra “cascading” updates), simpler (you remove some code), and less error-prone (you avoid bugs caused by different state variables getting out of sync with each other). If this approach feels new to you, Thinking in React explains what should go into state.
This component computes visibleTodos by taking the todos it receives by props and filtering them according to the filter prop. You might feel tempted to store the result in state and update it from an Effect:
Like in the earlier example, this is both unnecessary and inefficient. First, remove the state and the Effect:
Usually, this code is fine! But maybe getFilteredTodos() is slow or you have a lot of todos. In that case you don’t want to recalculate getFilteredTodos() if some unrelated state variable like newTodo has changed.
You can cache (or “memoize”) an expensive calculation by wrapping it in a useMemo Hook:
Or, written as a single line:
This tells React that you don’t want the inner function to re-run unless either todos or filter have changed. React will remember the return value of getFilteredTodos() during the initial render. During the next renders, it will check if todos or filter are different. If they’re the same as last time, useMemo will return the last result it has stored. But if they are different, React will call the inner function again (and store its result).
The function you wrap in useMemo runs during rendering, so this only works for pure calculations.





This ProfilePage component receives a userId prop. The page contains a comment input, and you use a comment state variable to hold its value. One day, you notice a problem: when you navigate from one profile to another, the comment state does not get reset. As a result, it’s easy to accidentally post a comment on a wrong user’s profile. To fix the issue, you want to clear out the comment state variable whenever the userId changes:
This is inefficient because ProfilePage and its children will first render with the stale value, and then render again. It is also complicated because you’d need to do this in every component that has some state inside ProfilePage. For example, if the comment UI is nested, you’d want to clear out nested comment state too.
Instead, you can tell React that each user’s profile is conceptually a different profile by giving it an explicit key. Split your component in two and pass a key attribute from the outer component to the inner one:
Normally, React preserves the state when the same component is rendered in the same spot. By passing userId as a key to the Profile component, you’re asking React to treat two Profile components with different userId as two different components that should not share any state. Whenever the key (which you’ve set to userId) changes, React will recreate the DOM and reset the state of the Profile component and all of its children. Now the comment field will clear out automatically when navigating between profiles.
Note that in this example, only the outer ProfilePage component is exported and visible to other files in the project. Components rendering ProfilePage don’t need to pass the key to it: they pass userId as a regular prop. The fact ProfilePage passes it as a key to the inner Profile component is an implementation detail.
Sometimes, you might want to reset or adjust a part of the state on a prop change, but not all of it.
This List component receives a list of items as a prop, and maintains the selected item in the selection state variable. You want to reset the selection to null whenever the items prop receives a different array:
This, too, is not ideal. Every time the items change, the List and its child components will render with a stale selection value at first. Then React will update the DOM and run the Effects. Finally, the setSelection(null) call will cause another re-render of the List and its child components, restarting this whole process again.
Start by deleting the Effect. Instead, adjust the state directly during rendering:
Storing information from previous renders like this can be hard to understand, but it’s better than updating the same state in an Effect. In the above example, setSelection is called directly during a render. React will re-render the List immediately after it exits with a return statement. React has not rendered the List children or updated the DOM yet, so this lets the List children skip rendering the stale selection value.
When you update a component during rendering, React throws away the returned JSX and immediately retries rendering. To avoid very slow cascading retries, React only lets you update the same component’s state during a render. If you update another component’s state during a render, you’ll see an error. A condition like items !== prevItems is necessary to avoid loops. You may adjust state like this, but any other side effects (like changing the DOM or setting timeouts) should stay in event handlers or Effects to keep components pure.
Although this pattern is more efficient than an Effect, most components shouldn’t need it either. No matter how you do it, adjusting state based on props or other state makes your data flow more difficult to understand and debug. Always check whether you can reset all state with a key or calculate everything during rendering instead. For example, instead of storing (and resetting) the selected item, you can store the selected item ID:
Now there is no need to “adjust” the state at all. If the item with the selected ID is in the list, it remains selected. If it’s not, the selection calculated during rendering will be null because no matching item was found. This behavior is different, but arguably better because most changes to items preserve the selection.
Let’s say you have a product page with two buttons (Buy and Checkout) that both let you buy that product. You want to show a notification whenever the user puts the product in the cart. Calling showNotification() in both buttons’ click handlers feels repetitive so you might be tempted to place this logic in an Effect:
This Effect is unnecessary. It will also most likely cause bugs. For example, let’s say that your app “remembers” the shopping cart between the page reloads. If you add a product to the cart once and refresh the page, the notification will appear again. It will keep appearing every time you refresh that product’s page. This is because product.isInCart will already be true on the page load, so the Effect above will call showNotification().
When you’re not sure whether some code should be in an Effect or in an event handler, ask yourself why this code needs to run. Use Effects only for code that should run because the component was displayed to the user. In this example, the notification should appear because the user pressed the button, not because the page was displayed! Delete the Effect and put the shared logic into a function called from both event handlers:
This both removes the unnecessary Effect and fixes the bug.
This Form component sends two kinds of POST requests. It sends an analytics event when it mounts. When you fill in the form and click the Submit button, it will send a POST request to the /api/register endpoint:
Let’s apply the same criteria as in the example before.
The analytics POST request should remain in an Effect. This is because the reason to send the analytics event is that the form was displayed. (It would fire twice in development, but see here for how to deal with that.)
However, the /api/register POST request is not caused by the form being displayed. You only want to send the request at one specific moment in time: when the user presses the button. It should only ever happen on that particular interaction. Delete the second Effect and move that POST request into the event handler:
When you choose whether to put some logic into an event handler or an Effect, the main question you need to answer is what kind of logic it is from the user’s perspective. If this logic is caused by a particular interaction, keep it in the event handler. If it’s caused by the user seeing the component on the screen, keep it in the Effect.
Sometimes you might feel tempted to chain Effects that each adjust a piece of state based on other state:
There are two problems with this code.
The first problem is that it is very inefficient: the component (and its children) have to re-render between each set call in the chain. In the example above, in the worst case (setCard → render → setGoldCardCount → render → setRound → render → setIsGameOver → render) there are three unnecessary re-renders of the tree below.
The second problem is that even if it weren’t slow, as your code evolves, you will run into cases where the “chain” you wrote doesn’t fit the new requirements. Imagine you are adding a way to step through the history of the game moves. You’d do it by updating each state variable to a value from the past. However, setting the card state to a value from the past would trigger the Effect chain again and change the data you’re showing. Such code is often rigid and fragile.
In this case, it’s better to calculate what you can during rendering, and adjust the state in the event handler:
This is a lot more efficient. Also, if you implement a way to view game history, now you will be able to set each state variable to a move from the past without triggering the Effect chain that adjusts every other value. If you need to reuse logic between several event handlers, you can extract a function and call it from those handlers.
Remember that inside event handlers, state behaves like a snapshot. For example, even after you call setRound(round + 1), the round variable will reflect the value at the time the user clicked the button. If you need to use the next value for calculations, define it manually like const nextRound = round + 1.
In some cases, you can’t calculate the next state directly in the event handler. For example, imagine a form with multiple dropdowns where the options of the next dropdown depend on the selected value of the previous dropdown. Then, a chain of Effects is appropriate because you are synchronizing with network.
Some logic should only run once when the app loads.
You might be tempted to place it in an Effect in the top-level component:
However, you’ll quickly discover that it runs twice in development. This can cause issues—for example, maybe it invalidates the authentication token because the function wasn’t designed to be called twice. In general, your components should be resilient to being remounted. This includes your top-level App component.
Although it may not ever get remounted in practice in production, following the same constraints in all components makes it easier to move and reuse code. If some logic must run once per app load rather than once per component mount, add a top-level variable to track whether it has already executed:
You can also run it during module initialization and before the app renders:
Code at the top level runs once when your component is imported—even if it doesn’t end up being rendered. To avoid slowdown or surprising behavior when importing arbitrary components, don’t overuse this pattern. Keep app-wide initialization logic to root component modules like App.js or in your application’s entry point.
Let’s say you’re writing a Toggle component with an internal isOn state which can be either true or false. There are a few different ways to toggle it (by clicking or dragging). You want to notify the parent component whenever the Toggle internal state changes, so you expose an onChange event and call it from an Effect:
Like earlier, this is not ideal. The Toggle updates its state first, and React updates the screen. Then React runs the Effect, which calls the onChange function passed from a parent component. Now the parent component will update its own state, starting another render pass. It would be better to do everything in a single pass.
Delete the Effect and instead update the state of both components within the same event handler:
With this approach, both the Toggle component and its parent component update their state during the event. React batches updates from different components together, so there will only be one render pass.
You might also be able to remove the state altogether, and instead receive isOn from the parent component:
“Lifting state up” lets the parent component fully control the Toggle by toggling the parent’s own state. This means the parent component will have to contain more logic, but there will be less state overall to worry about. Whenever you try to keep two different state variables synchronized, try lifting state up instead!
This Child component fetches some data and then passes it to the Parent component in an Effect:
In React, data flows from the parent components to their children. When you see something wrong on the screen, you can trace where the information comes from by going up the component chain until you find which component passes the wrong prop or has the wrong state. When child components update the state of their parent components in Effects, the data flow becomes very difficult to trace. Since both the child and the parent need the same data, let the parent component fetch that data, and pass it down to the child instead:
This is simpler and keeps the data flow predictable: the data flows down from the parent to the child.
Sometimes, your components may need to subscribe to some data outside of the React state. This data could be from a third-party library or a built-in browser API. Since this data can change without React’s knowledge, you need to manually subscribe your components to it. This is often done with an Effect, for example:
Here, the component subscribes to an external data store (in this case, the browser navigator.onLine API). Since this API does not exist on the server (so it can’t be used for the initial HTML), initially the state is set to true. Whenever the value of that data store changes in the browser, the component updates its state.
Although it’s common to use Effects for this, React has a purpose-built Hook for subscribing to an external store that is preferred instead. Delete the Effect and replace it with a call to useSyncExternalStore:
This approach is less error-prone than manually syncing mutable data to React state with an Effect. Typically, you’ll write a custom Hook like useOnlineStatus() above so that you don’t need to repeat this code in the individual components. Read more about subscribing to external stores from React components.
Many apps use Effects to kick off data fetching. It is quite common to write a data fetching Effect like this:
You don’t need to move this fetch to an event handler.
This might seem like a contradiction with the earlier examples where you needed to put the logic into the event handlers! However, consider that it’s not the typing event that’s the main reason to fetch. Search inputs are often prepopulated from the URL, and the user might navigate Back and Forward without touching the input.
It doesn’t matter where page and query come from. While this component is visible, you want to keep results synchronized with data from the network for the current page and query. This is why it’s an Effect.
However, the code above has a bug. Imagine you type ""hello"" fast. Then the query will change from ""h"", to ""he"", ""hel"", ""hell"", and ""hello"". This will kick off separate fetches, but there is no guarantee about which order the responses will arrive in. For example, the ""hell"" response may arrive after the ""hello"" response. Since it will call setResults() last, you will be displaying the wrong search results. This is called a “race condition”: two different requests “raced” against each other and came in a different order than you expected.
To fix the race condition, you need to add a cleanup function to ignore stale responses:
This ensures that when your Effect fetches data, all responses except the last requested one will be ignored.
Handling race conditions is not the only difficulty with implementing data fetching. You might also want to think about caching responses (so that the user can click Back and see the previous screen instantly), how to fetch data on the server (so that the initial server-rendered HTML contains the fetched content instead of a spinner), and how to avoid network waterfalls (so that a child can fetch data without waiting for every parent).
These issues apply to any UI library, not just React. Solving them is not trivial, which is why modern frameworks provide more efficient built-in data fetching mechanisms than fetching data in Effects.
If you don’t use a framework (and don’t want to build your own) but would like to make data fetching from Effects more ergonomic, consider extracting your fetching logic into a custom Hook like in this example:
You’ll likely also want to add some logic for error handling and to track whether the content is loading. You can build a Hook like this yourself or use one of the many solutions already available in the React ecosystem. Although this alone won’t be as efficient as using a framework’s built-in data fetching mechanism, moving the data fetching logic into a custom Hook will make it easier to adopt an efficient data fetching strategy later.
In general, whenever you have to resort to writing Effects, keep an eye out for when you can extract a piece of functionality into a custom Hook with a more declarative and purpose-built API like useData above. The fewer raw useEffect calls you have in your components, the easier you will find to maintain your application.
If you can calculate something during render, you don’t need an Effect.
To cache expensive calculations, add useMemo instead of useEffect.
To reset the state of an entire component tree, pass a different key to it.
To reset a particular bit of state in response to a prop change, set it during rendering.
Code that runs because a component was displayed should be in Effects, the rest should be in events.
If you need to update the state of several components, it’s better to do it during a single event.
Whenever you try to synchronize state variables in different components, consider lifting state up.
You can fetch data with Effects, but you need to implement cleanup to avoid race conditions.
The TodoList below displays a list of todos. When the “Show only active todos” checkbox is ticked, completed todos are not displayed in the list. Regardless of which todos are visible, the footer displays the count of todos that are not yet completed.
Simplify this component by removing all the unnecessary state and Effects.

```
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');

  // 🔴 Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary Effect
  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');
  useEffect(() => {
    setFullName(firstName + ' ' + lastName);
  }, [firstName, lastName]);
  // ...
}
```


```
function Form() {

Effects have a different lifecycle from components. Components may mount, update, or unmount. An Effect can only do two things: to start synchronizing something, and later to stop synchronizing it. This cycle can happen multiple times if your Effect depends on props and state that change over time. React provides a linter rule to check that you’ve specified your Effect’s dependencies correctly. This keeps your Effect synchronized to the latest props and state.

Every React component goes through the same lifecycle:
A component mounts when it’s added to the screen.
A component updates when it receives new props or state, usually in response to an interaction.
A component unmounts when it’s removed from the screen.
It’s a good way to think about components, but not about Effects. Instead, try to think about each Effect independently from your component’s lifecycle. An Effect describes how to synchronize an external system to the current props and state. As your code changes, synchronization will need to happen more or less often.
To illustrate this point, consider this Effect connecting your component to a chat server:
Your Effect’s body specifies how to start synchronizing:
The cleanup function returned by your Effect specifies how to stop synchronizing:
Intuitively, you might think that React would start synchronizing when your component mounts and stop synchronizing when your component unmounts. However, this is not the end of the story! Sometimes, it may also be necessary to start and stop synchronizing multiple times while the component remains mounted.
Let’s look at why this is necessary, when it happens, and how you can control this behavior.
Some Effects don’t return a cleanup function at all. More often than not, you’ll want to return one—but if you don’t, React will behave as if you returned an empty cleanup function.
Imagine this ChatRoom component receives a roomId prop that the user picks in a dropdown. Let’s say that initially the user picks the ""general"" room as the roomId. Your app displays the ""general"" chat room:
After the UI is displayed, React will run your Effect to start synchronizing. It connects to the ""general"" room:
So far, so good.
Later, the user picks a different room in the dropdown (for example, ""travel""). First, React will update the UI:
Think about what should happen next. The user sees that ""travel"" is the selected chat room in the UI. However, the Effect that ran the last time is still connected to the ""general"" room. The roomId prop has changed, so what your Effect did back then (connecting to the ""general"" room) no longer matches the UI.
At this point, you want React to do two things:
Stop synchronizing with the old roomId (disconnect from the ""general"" room)
Start synchronizing with the new roomId (connect to the ""travel"" room)
Luckily, you’ve already taught React how to do both of these things! Your Effect’s body specifies how to start synchronizing, and your cleanup function specifies how to stop synchronizing. All that React needs to do now is to call them in the correct order and with the correct props and state. Let’s see how exactly that happens.
Recall that your ChatRoom component has received a new value for its roomId prop. It used to be ""general"", and now it is ""travel"". React needs to re-synchronize your Effect to re-connect you to a different room.
To stop synchronizing, React will call the cleanup function that your Effect returned after connecting to the ""general"" room. Since roomId was ""general"", the cleanup function disconnects from the ""general"" room:
Then React will run the Effect that you’ve provided during this render. This time, roomId is ""travel"" so it will start synchronizing to the ""travel"" chat room (until its cleanup function is eventually called too):
Thanks to this, you’re now connected to the same room that the user chose in the UI. Disaster averted!
Every time after your component re-renders with a different roomId, your Effect will re-synchronize. For example, let’s say the user changes roomId from ""travel"" to ""music"". React will again stop synchronizing your Effect by calling its cleanup function (disconnecting you from the ""travel"" room). Then it will start synchronizing again by running its body with the new roomId prop (connecting you to the ""music"" room).
Finally, when the user goes to a different screen, ChatRoom unmounts. Now there is no need to stay connected at all. React will stop synchronizing your Effect one last time and disconnect you from the ""music"" chat room.
Let’s recap everything that’s happened from the ChatRoom component’s perspective:
ChatRoom mounted with roomId set to ""general""
ChatRoom updated with roomId set to ""travel""
ChatRoom updated with roomId set to ""music""
ChatRoom unmounted
During each of these points in the component’s lifecycle, your Effect did different things:
Your Effect connected to the ""general"" room
Your Effect disconnected from the ""general"" room and connected to the ""travel"" room
Your Effect disconnected from the ""travel"" room and connected to the ""music"" room
Your Effect disconnected from the ""music"" room
Now let’s think about what happened from the perspective of the Effect itself:
This code’s structure might inspire you to see what happened as a sequence of non-overlapping time periods:
Your Effect connected to the ""general"" room (until it disconnected)
Your Effect connected to the ""travel"" room (until it disconnected)
Your Effect connected to the ""music"" room (until it disconnected)
Previously, you were thinking from the component’s perspective. When you looked from the component’s perspective, it was tempting to think of Effects as “callbacks” or “lifecycle events” that fire at a specific time like “after a render” or “before unmount”. This way of thinking gets complicated very fast, so it’s best to avoid.
Instead, always focus on a single start/stop cycle at a time. It shouldn’t matter whether a component is mounting, updating, or unmounting. All you need to do is to describe how to start synchronization and how to stop it. If you do it well, your Effect will be resilient to being started and stopped as many times as it’s needed.
This might remind you how you don’t think whether a component is mounting or updating when you write the rendering logic that creates JSX. You describe what should be on the screen, and React figures out the rest.
Here is a live example that you can play with. Press “Open chat” to mount the ChatRoom component:
Notice that when the component mounts for the first time, you see three logs:
✅ Connecting to ""general"" room at https://localhost:1234... (development-only)
❌ Disconnected from ""general"" room at https://localhost:1234. (development-only)
✅ Connecting to ""general"" room at https://localhost:1234...
The first two logs are development-only. In development, React always remounts each component once.
React verifies that your Effect can re-synchronize by forcing it to do that immediately in development. This might remind you of opening a door and closing it an extra time to check if the door lock works. React starts and stops your Effect one extra time in development to check you’ve implemented its cleanup well.
The main reason your Effect will re-synchronize in practice is if some data it uses has changed. In the sandbox above, change the selected chat room. Notice how, when the roomId changes, your Effect re-synchronizes.
However, there are also more unusual cases in which re-synchronization is necessary. For example, try editing the serverUrl in the sandbox above while the chat is open. Notice how the Effect re-synchronizes in response to your edits to the code. In the future, React may add more features that rely on re-synchronization.
You might be wondering how React knew that your Effect needed to re-synchronize after roomId changes. It’s because you told React that its code depends on roomId by including it in the list of dependencies:
Here’s how this works:
You knew roomId is a prop, which means it can change over time.
You knew that your Effect reads roomId (so its logic depends on a value that may change later).
This is why you specified it as your Effect’s dependency (so that it re-synchronizes when roomId changes).
Every time after your component re-renders, React will look at the array of dependencies that you have passed. If any of the values in the array is different from the value at the same spot that you passed during the previous render, React will re-synchronize your Effect.
For example, if you passed [""general""] during the initial render, and later you passed [""travel""] during the next render, React will compare ""general"" and ""travel"". These are different values (compared with Object.is), so React will re-synchronize your Effect. On the other hand, if your component re-renders but roomId has not changed, your Effect will remain connected to the same room.
Resist adding unrelated logic to your Effect only because this logic needs to run at the same time as an Effect you already wrote. For example, let’s say you want to send an analytics event when the user visits the room. You already have an Effect that depends on roomId, so you might feel tempted to add the analytics call there:
But imagine you later add another dependency to this Effect that needs to re-establish the connection. If this Effect re-synchronizes, it will also call logVisit(roomId) for the same room, which you did not intend. Logging the visit is a separate process from connecting. Write them as two separate Effects:
Each Effect in your code should represent a separate and independent synchronization process.
In the above example, deleting one Effect wouldn’t break the other Effect’s logic. This is a good indication that they synchronize different things, and so it made sense to split them up. On the other hand, if you split up a cohesive piece of logic into separate Effects, the code may look “cleaner” but will be more difficult to maintain. This is why you should think whether the processes are same or separate, not whether the code looks cleaner.
Your Effect reads two variables (serverUrl and roomId), but you only specified roomId as a dependency:
Why doesn’t serverUrl need to be a dependency?
This is because the serverUrl never changes due to a re-render. It’s always the same no matter how many times the component re-renders and why. Since serverUrl never changes, it wouldn’t make sense to specify it as a dependency. After all, dependencies only do something when they change over time!
On the other hand, roomId may be different on a re-render. Props, state, and other values declared inside the component are reactive because they’re calculated during rendering and participate in the React data flow.
If serverUrl was a state variable, it would be reactive. Reactive values must be included in dependencies:
By including serverUrl as a dependency, you ensure that the Effect re-synchronizes after it changes.
Try changing the selected chat room or edit the server URL in this sandbox:
Whenever you change a reactive value like roomId or serverUrl, the Effect re-connects to the chat server.
What happens if you move both serverUrl and roomId outside the component?
Now your Effect’s code does not use any reactive values, so its dependencies can be empty ([]).
Thinking from the component’s perspective, the empty [] dependency array means this Effect connects to the chat room only when the component mounts, and disconnects only when the component unmounts. (Keep in mind that React would still re-synchronize it an extra time in development to stress-test your logic.)
However, if you think from the Effect’s perspective, you don’t need to think about mounting and unmounting at all. What’s important is you’ve specified what your Effect does to start and stop synchronizing. Today, it has no reactive dependencies. But if you ever want the user to change roomId or serverUrl over time (and they would become reactive), your Effect’s code won’t change. You will only need to add them to the dependencies.
Props and state aren’t the only reactive values. Values that you calculate from them are also reactive. If the props or state change, your component will re-render, and the values calculated from them will also change. This is why all variables from the component body used by the Effect should be in the Effect dependency list.
Let’s say that the user can pick a chat server in the dropdown, but they can also configure a default server in settings. Suppose you’ve already put the settings state in a context so you read the settings from that context. Now you calculate the serverUrl based on the selected server from props and the default server:
In this example, serverUrl is not a prop or a state variable. It’s a regular variable that you calculate during rendering. But it’s calculated during rendering, so it can change due to a re-render. This is why it’s reactive.
All values inside the component (including props, state, and variables in your component’s body) are reactive. Any reactive value can change on a re-render, so you need to include reactive values as Effect’s dependencies.
In other words, Effects “react” to all values from the component body.




If your linter is configured for React, it will check that every reactive value used by your Effect’s code is declared as its dependency. For example, this is a lint error because both roomId and serverUrl are reactive:
This may look like a React error, but really React is pointing out a bug in your code. Both roomId and serverUrl may change over time, but you’re forgetting to re-synchronize your Effect when they change. You will remain connected to the initial roomId and serverUrl even after the user picks different values in the UI.
To fix the bug, follow the linter’s suggestion to specify roomId and serverUrl as dependencies of your Effect:
Try this fix in the sandbox above. Verify that the linter error is gone, and the chat re-connects when needed.
In some cases, React knows that a value never changes even though it’s declared inside the component. For example, the set function returned from useState and the ref object returned by useRef are stable—they are guaranteed to not change on a re-render. Stable values aren’t reactive, so you may omit them from the list. Including them is allowed: they won’t change, so it doesn’t matter.
In the previous example, you’ve fixed the lint error by listing roomId and serverUrl as dependencies.
However, you could instead “prove” to the linter that these values aren’t reactive values, i.e. that they can’t change as a result of a re-render. For example, if serverUrl and roomId don’t depend on rendering and always have the same values, you can move them outside the component. Now they don’t need to be dependencies:
You can also move them inside the Effect. They aren’t calculated during rendering, so they’re not reactive:
Effects are reactive blocks of code. They re-synchronize when the values you read inside of them change. Unlike event handlers, which only run once per interaction, Effects run whenever synchronization is necessary.
You can’t “choose” your dependencies. Your dependencies must include every reactive value you read in the Effect. The linter enforces this. Sometimes this may lead to problems like infinite loops and to your Effect re-synchronizing too often. Don’t fix these problems by suppressing the linter! Here’s what to try instead:
Check that your Effect represents an independent synchronization process. If your Effect doesn’t synchronize anything, it might be unnecessary. If it synchronizes several independent things, split it up.
Check that your Effect represents an independent synchronization process. If your Effect doesn’t synchronize anything, it might be unnecessary. If it synchronizes several independent things, split it up.
If you want to read the latest value of props or state without “reacting” to it and re-synchronizing the Effect, you can split your Effect into a reactive part (which you’ll keep in the Effect) and a non-reactive part (which you’ll extract into something called an Effect Event).

Avoid relying on objects and functions as dependencies. If you create objects and functions during rendering and then read them from an Effect, they will be different on every render. This will cause your Effect to re-synchronize every time. Read more about removing unnecessary dependencies from Effects.

The linter is your friend, but its powers are limited. The linter only knows when the dependencies are wrong. It doesn’t know the best way to solve each case. If the linter suggests a dependency, but adding it causes a loop, it doesn’t mean the linter should be ignored. You need to change the code inside (or outside) the Effect so that that value isn’t reactive and doesn’t need to be a dependency.
If you have an existing codebase, you might have some Effects that suppress the linter like this:
On the next pages, you’ll learn how to fix this code without breaking the rules. It’s always worth fixing!
Components can mount, update, and unmount.
Each Effect has a separate lifecycle from the surrounding component.
Each Effect describes a separate synchronization process that can start and stop.
When you write and read Effects, think from each individual Effect’s perspective (how to start and stop synchronization) rather than from the component’s perspective (how it mounts, updates, or unmounts).
Values declared inside the component body are “reactive”.
Reactive values should re-synchronize the Effect because they can change over time.
The linter verifies that all reactive values used inside the Effect are specified as dependencies.
All errors flagged by the linter are legitimate. There’s always a way to fix the code to not break the rules.
In this example, the ChatRoom component connects to the chat room when the component mounts, disconnects when it unmounts, and reconnects when you select a different chat room. This behavior is correct, so you need to keep it working.
However, there is a problem. Whenever you type into the message box input at the bottom, ChatRoom also reconnects to the chat. (You can notice this by clearing the console and typing into the input.) Fix the issue so that this doesn’t happen.

# Challenge 1 of 4: Fix a variable that doesn’t update

Event handlers only re-run when you perform the same interaction again. Unlike event handlers, Effects re-synchronize if some value they read, like a prop or a state variable, is different from what it was during the last render. Sometimes, you also want a mix of both behaviors: an Effect that re-runs in response to some values but not others. This page will teach you how to do that.
How to choose between an event handler and an Effect
Why Effects are reactive, and event handlers are not
What to do when you want a part of your Effect’s code to not be reactive
What Effect Events are, and how to extract them from your Effects
How to read the latest props and state from Effects using Effect Events
First, let’s recap the difference between event handlers and Effects.
Imagine you’re implementing a chat room component. Your requirements look like this:
Your component should automatically connect to the selected chat room.
When you click the “Send” button, it should send a message to the chat.
Let’s say you’ve already implemented the code for them, but you’re not sure where to put it. Should you use event handlers or Effects? Every time you need to answer this question, consider why the code needs to run.
From the user’s perspective, sending a message should happen because the particular “Send” button was clicked. The user will get rather upset if you send their message at any other time or for any other reason. This is why sending a message should be an event handler. Event handlers let you handle specific interactions:
With an event handler, you can be sure that sendMessage(message) will only run if the user presses the button.
Recall that you also need to keep the component connected to the chat room. Where does that code go?
The reason to run this code is not some particular interaction. It doesn’t matter why or how the user navigated to the chat room screen. Now that they’re looking at it and could interact with it, the component needs to stay connected to the selected chat server. Even if the chat room component was the initial screen of your app, and the user has not performed any interactions at all, you would still need to connect. This is why it’s an Effect:
With this code, you can be sure that there is always an active connection to the currently selected chat server, regardless of the specific interactions performed by the user. Whether the user has only opened your app, selected a different room, or navigated to another screen and back, your Effect ensures that the component will remain synchronized with the currently selected room, and will re-connect whenever it’s necessary.
Intuitively, you could say that event handlers are always triggered “manually”, for example by clicking a button. Effects, on the other hand, are “automatic”: they run and re-run as often as it’s needed to stay synchronized.
There is a more precise way to think about this.
Props, state, and variables declared inside your component’s body are called reactive values. In this example, serverUrl is not a reactive value, but roomId and message are. They participate in the rendering data flow:
Reactive values like these can change due to a re-render. For example, the user may edit the message or choose a different roomId in a dropdown. Event handlers and Effects respond to changes differently:
Logic inside event handlers is not reactive. It will not run again unless the user performs the same interaction (e.g. a click) again. Event handlers can read reactive values without “reacting” to their changes.
Logic inside Effects is reactive. If your Effect reads a reactive value, you have to specify it as a dependency. Then, if a re-render causes that value to change, React will re-run your Effect’s logic with the new value.
Let’s revisit the previous example to illustrate this difference.
Take a look at this line of code. Should this logic be reactive or not?
From the user’s perspective, a change to the message does not mean that they want to send a message. It only means that the user is typing. In other words, the logic that sends a message should not be reactive. It should not run again only because the reactive value has changed. That’s why it belongs in the event handler:
Event handlers aren’t reactive, so sendMessage(message) will only run when the user clicks the Send button.
Now let’s return to these lines:
From the user’s perspective, a change to the roomId does mean that they want to connect to a different room. In other words, the logic for connecting to the room should be reactive. You want these lines of code to “keep up” with the reactive value, and to run again if that value is different. That’s why it belongs in an Effect:
Effects are reactive, so createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) and connection.connect() will run for every distinct value of roomId. Your Effect keeps the chat connection synchronized to the currently selected room.
Things get more tricky when you want to mix reactive logic with non-reactive logic.
For example, imagine that you want to show a notification when the user connects to the chat. You read the current theme (dark or light) from the props so that you can show the notification in the correct color:
However, theme is a reactive value (it can change as a result of re-rendering), and every reactive value read by an Effect must be declared as its dependency. Now you have to specify theme as a dependency of your Effect:
Play with this example and see if you can spot the problem with this user experience:
When the roomId changes, the chat re-connects as you would expect. But since theme is also a dependency, the chat also re-connects every time you switch between the dark and the light theme. That’s not great!
In other words, you don’t want this line to be reactive, even though it is inside an Effect (which is reactive):
You need a way to separate this non-reactive logic from the reactive Effect around it.
This section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React.
Use a special Hook called useEffectEvent to extract this non-reactive logic out of your Effect:
Here, onConnected is called an Effect Event. It’s a part of your Effect logic, but it behaves a lot more like an event handler. The logic inside it is not reactive, and it always “sees” the latest values of your props and state.
Now you can call the onConnected Effect Event from inside your Effect:
This solves the problem. Note that you had to remove onConnected from the list of your Effect’s dependencies. Effect Events are not reactive and must be omitted from dependencies.
Verify that the new behavior works as you would expect:
You can think of Effect Events as being very similar to event handlers. The main difference is that event handlers run in response to a user interactions, whereas Effect Events are triggered by you from Effects. Effect Events let you “break the chain” between the reactivity of Effects and code that should not be reactive.
This section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React.
Effect Events let you fix many patterns where you might be tempted to suppress the dependency linter.
For example, say you have an Effect to log the page visits:
Later, you add multiple routes to your site. Now your Page component receives a url prop with the current path. You want to pass the url as a part of your logVisit call, but the dependency linter complains:
Think about what you want the code to do. You want to log a separate visit for different URLs since each URL represents a different page. In other words, this logVisit call should be reactive with respect to the url. This is why, in this case, it makes sense to follow the dependency linter, and add url as a dependency:
Now let’s say you want to include the number of items in the shopping cart together with every page visit:
You used numberOfItems inside the Effect, so the linter asks you to add it as a dependency. However, you don’t want the logVisit call to be reactive with respect to numberOfItems. If the user puts something into the shopping cart, and the numberOfItems changes, this does not mean that the user visited the page again. In other words, visiting the page is, in some sense, an “event”. It happens at a precise moment in time.
Split the code in two parts:
Here, onVisit is an Effect Event. The code inside it isn’t reactive. This is why you can use numberOfItems (or any other reactive value!) without worrying that it will cause the surrounding code to re-execute on changes.
On the other hand, the Effect itself remains reactive. Code inside the Effect uses the url prop, so the Effect will re-run after every re-render with a different url. This, in turn, will call the onVisit Effect Event.
As a result, you will call logVisit for every change to the url, and always read the latest numberOfItems. However, if numberOfItems changes on its own, this will not cause any of the code to re-run.
You might be wondering if you could call onVisit() with no arguments, and read the url inside it:
This would work, but it’s better to pass this url to the Effect Event explicitly. By passing url as an argument to your Effect Event, you are saying that visiting a page with a different url constitutes a separate “event” from the user’s perspective. The visitedUrl is a part of the “event” that happened:
Since your Effect Event explicitly “asks” for the visitedUrl, now you can’t accidentally remove url from the Effect’s dependencies. If you remove the url dependency (causing distinct page visits to be counted as one), the linter will warn you about it. You want onVisit to be reactive with regards to the url, so instead of reading the url inside (where it wouldn’t be reactive), you pass it from your Effect.
This becomes especially important if there is some asynchronous logic inside the Effect:
Here, url inside onVisit corresponds to the latest url (which could have already changed), but visitedUrl corresponds to the url that originally caused this Effect (and this onVisit call) to run.











This section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React.
Effect Events are very limited in how you can use them:
Only call them from inside Effects.
Never pass them to other components or Hooks.
For example, don’t declare and pass an Effect Event like this:
Instead, always declare Effect Events directly next to the Effects that use them:
Effect Events are non-reactive “pieces” of your Effect code. They should be next to the Effect using them.
Event handlers run in response to specific interactions.
Effects run whenever synchronization is needed.
Logic inside event handlers is not reactive.
Logic inside Effects is reactive.
You can move non-reactive logic from Effects into Effect Events.
Only call Effect Events from inside Effects.
Don’t pass Effect Events to other components or Hooks.
This Timer component keeps a count state variable which increases every second. The value by which it’s increasing is stored in the increment state variable. You can control the increment variable with the plus and minus buttons.
However, no matter how many times you click the plus button, the counter is still incremented by one every second. What’s wrong with this code? Why is increment always equal to 1 inside the Effect’s code? Find the mistake and fix it.

When you write an Effect, the linter will verify that you’ve included every reactive value (like props and state) that the Effect reads in the list of your Effect’s dependencies. This ensures that your Effect remains synchronized with the latest props and state of your component. Unnecessary dependencies may cause your Effect to run too often, or even create an infinite loop. Follow this guide to review and remove unnecessary dependencies from your Effects.
How to fix infinite Effect dependency loops
What to do when you want to remove a dependency
How to read a value from your Effect without “reacting” to it
How and why to avoid object and function dependencies
Why suppressing the dependency linter is dangerous, and what to do instead
When you write an Effect, you first specify how to start and stop whatever you want your Effect to be doing:
Then, if you leave the Effect dependencies empty ([]), the linter will suggest the correct dependencies:
Fill them in according to what the linter says:
Effects “react” to reactive values. Since roomId is a reactive value (it can change due to a re-render), the linter verifies that you’ve specified it as a dependency. If roomId receives a different value, React will re-synchronize your Effect. This ensures that the chat stays connected to the selected room and “reacts” to the dropdown:
Notice that you can’t “choose” the dependencies of your Effect. Every reactive value used by your Effect’s code must be declared in your dependency list. The dependency list is determined by the surrounding code:
Reactive values include props and all variables and functions declared directly inside of your component. Since roomId is a reactive value, you can’t remove it from the dependency list. The linter wouldn’t allow it:
And the linter would be right! Since roomId may change over time, this would introduce a bug in your code.
To remove a dependency, “prove” to the linter that it doesn’t need to be a dependency. For example, you can move roomId out of your component to prove that it’s not reactive and won’t change on re-renders:
Now that roomId is not a reactive value (and can’t change on a re-render), it doesn’t need to be a dependency:
This is why you could now specify an empty ([]) dependency list. Your Effect really doesn’t depend on any reactive value anymore, so it really doesn’t need to re-run when any of the component’s props or state change.
You might have noticed a pattern in your workflow:
First, you change the code of your Effect or how your reactive values are declared.
Then, you follow the linter and adjust the dependencies to match the code you have changed.
If you’re not happy with the list of dependencies, you go back to the first step (and change the code again).
The last part is important. If you want to change the dependencies, change the surrounding code first. You can think of the dependency list as a list of all the reactive values used by your Effect’s code. You don’t choose what to put on that list. The list describes your code. To change the dependency list, change the code.
This might feel like solving an equation. You might start with a goal (for example, to remove a dependency), and you need to “find” the code matching that goal. Not everyone finds solving equations fun, and the same thing could be said about writing Effects! Luckily, there is a list of common recipes that you can try below.
If you have an existing codebase, you might have some Effects that suppress the linter like this:
When dependencies don’t match the code, there is a very high risk of introducing bugs. By suppressing the linter, you “lie” to React about the values your Effect depends on.
Instead, use the techniques below.





Every time you adjust the Effect’s dependencies to reflect the code, look at the dependency list. Does it make sense for the Effect to re-run when any of these dependencies change? Sometimes, the answer is “no”:
You might want to re-execute different parts of your Effect under different conditions.
You might want to only read the latest value of some dependency instead of “reacting” to its changes.
A dependency may change too often unintentionally because it’s an object or a function.
To find the right solution, you’ll need to answer a few questions about your Effect. Let’s walk through them.
The first thing you should think about is whether this code should be an Effect at all.
Imagine a form. On submit, you set the submitted state variable to true. You need to send a POST request and show a notification. You’ve put this logic inside an Effect that “reacts” to submitted being true:
Later, you want to style the notification message according to the current theme, so you read the current theme. Since theme is declared in the component body, it is a reactive value, so you add it as a dependency:
By doing this, you’ve introduced a bug. Imagine you submit the form first and then switch between Dark and Light themes. The theme will change, the Effect will re-run, and so it will display the same notification again!
The problem here is that this shouldn’t be an Effect in the first place. You want to send this POST request and show the notification in response to submitting the form, which is a particular interaction. To run some code in response to particular interaction, put that logic directly into the corresponding event handler:
Now that the code is in an event handler, it’s not reactive—so it will only run when the user submits the form. Read more about choosing between event handlers and Effects and how to delete unnecessary Effects.
The next question you should ask yourself is whether your Effect is doing several unrelated things.
Imagine you’re creating a shipping form where the user needs to choose their city and area. You fetch the list of cities from the server according to the selected country to show them in a dropdown:
This is a good example of fetching data in an Effect. You are synchronizing the cities state with the network according to the country prop. You can’t do this in an event handler because you need to fetch as soon as ShippingForm is displayed and whenever the country changes (no matter which interaction causes it).
Now let’s say you’re adding a second select box for city areas, which should fetch the areas for the currently selected city. You might start by adding a second fetch call for the list of areas inside the same Effect:
However, since the Effect now uses the city state variable, you’ve had to add city to the list of dependencies. That, in turn, introduced a problem: when the user selects a different city, the Effect will re-run and call fetchCities(country). As a result, you will be unnecessarily refetching the list of cities many times.
The problem with this code is that you’re synchronizing two different unrelated things:
You want to synchronize the cities state to the network based on the country prop.
You want to synchronize the areas state to the network based on the city state.
Split the logic into two Effects, each of which reacts to the prop that it needs to synchronize with:
Now the first Effect only re-runs if the country changes, while the second Effect re-runs when the city changes. You’ve separated them by purpose: two different things are synchronized by two separate Effects. Two separate Effects have two separate dependency lists, so they won’t trigger each other unintentionally.
The final code is longer than the original, but splitting these Effects is still correct. Each Effect should represent an independent synchronization process. In this example, deleting one Effect doesn’t break the other Effect’s logic. This means they synchronize different things, and it’s good to split them up. If you’re concerned about duplication, you can improve this code by extracting repetitive logic into a custom Hook.
This Effect updates the messages state variable with a newly created array every time a new message arrives:
It uses the messages variable to create a new array starting with all the existing messages and adds the new message at the end. However, since messages is a reactive value read by an Effect, it must be a dependency:
And making messages a dependency introduces a problem.
Every time you receive a message, setMessages() causes the component to re-render with a new messages array that includes the received message. However, since this Effect now depends on messages, this will also re-synchronize the Effect. So every new message will make the chat re-connect. The user would not like that!
To fix the issue, don’t read messages inside the Effect. Instead, pass an updater function to setMessages:
Notice how your Effect does not read the messages variable at all now. You only need to pass an updater function like msgs => [...msgs, receivedMessage]. React puts your updater function in a queue and will provide the msgs argument to it during the next render. This is why the Effect itself doesn’t need to depend on messages anymore. As a result of this fix, receiving a chat message will no longer make the chat re-connect.
This section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React.
Suppose that you want to play a sound when the user receives a new message unless isMuted is true:
Since your Effect now uses isMuted in its code, you have to add it to the dependencies:
The problem is that every time isMuted changes (for example, when the user presses the “Muted” toggle), the Effect will re-synchronize, and reconnect to the chat. This is not the desired user experience! (In this example, even disabling the linter would not work—if you do that, isMuted would get “stuck” with its old value.)
To solve this problem, you need to extract the logic that shouldn’t be reactive out of the Effect. You don’t want this Effect to “react” to the changes in isMuted. Move this non-reactive piece of logic into an Effect Event:
Effect Events let you split an Effect into reactive parts (which should “react” to reactive values like roomId and their changes) and non-reactive parts (which only read their latest values, like onMessage reads isMuted). Now that you read isMuted inside an Effect Event, it doesn’t need to be a dependency of your Effect. As a result, the chat won’t re-connect when you toggle the “Muted” setting on and off, solving the original issue!
You might run into a similar problem when your component receives an event handler as a prop:
Suppose that the parent component passes a different onReceiveMessage function on every render:
Since onReceiveMessage is a dependency, it would cause the Effect to re-synchronize after every parent re-render. This would make it re-connect to the chat. To solve this, wrap the call in an Effect Event:
Effect Events aren’t reactive, so you don’t need to specify them as dependencies. As a result, the chat will no longer re-connect even if the parent component passes a function that’s different on every re-render.
In this example, you want to log a visit every time roomId changes. You want to include the current notificationCount with every log, but you don’t want a change to notificationCount to trigger a log event.
The solution is again to split out the non-reactive code into an Effect Event:
You want your logic to be reactive with regards to roomId, so you read roomId inside of your Effect. However, you don’t want a change to notificationCount to log an extra visit, so you read notificationCount inside of the Effect Event. Learn more about reading the latest props and state from Effects using Effect Events.
Sometimes, you do want your Effect to “react” to a certain value, but that value changes more often than you’d like—and might not reflect any actual change from the user’s perspective. For example, let’s say that you create an options object in the body of your component, and then read that object from inside of your Effect:
This object is declared in the component body, so it’s a reactive value. When you read a reactive value like this inside an Effect, you declare it as a dependency. This ensures your Effect “reacts” to its changes:
It is important to declare it as a dependency! This ensures, for example, that if the roomId changes, your Effect will re-connect to the chat with the new options. However, there is also a problem with the code above. To see it, try typing into the input in the sandbox below, and watch what happens in the console:
In the sandbox above, the input only updates the message state variable. From the user’s perspective, this should not affect the chat connection. However, every time you update the message, your component re-renders. When your component re-renders, the code inside of it runs again from scratch.
A new options object is created from scratch on every re-render of the ChatRoom component. React sees that the options object is a different object from the options object created during the last render. This is why it re-synchronizes your Effect (which depends on options), and the chat re-connects as you type.
This problem only affects objects and functions. In JavaScript, each newly created object and function is considered distinct from all the others. It doesn’t matter that the contents inside of them may be the same!
Object and function dependencies can make your Effect re-synchronize more often than you need.
This is why, whenever possible, you should try to avoid objects and functions as your Effect’s dependencies. Instead, try moving them outside the component, inside the Effect, or extracting primitive values out of them.
If the object does not depend on any props and state, you can move that object outside your component:
This way, you prove to the linter that it’s not reactive. It can’t change as a result of a re-render, so it doesn’t need to be a dependency. Now re-rendering ChatRoom won’t cause your Effect to re-synchronize.
This works for functions too:
Since createOptions is declared outside your component, it’s not a reactive value. This is why it doesn’t need to be specified in your Effect’s dependencies, and why it won’t ever cause your Effect to re-synchronize.
If your object depends on some reactive value that may change as a result of a re-render, like a roomId prop, you can’t pull it outside your component. You can, however, move its creation inside of your Effect’s code:
Now that options is declared inside of your Effect, it is no longer a dependency of your Effect. Instead, the only reactive value used by your Effect is roomId. Since roomId is not an object or function, you can be sure that it won’t be unintentionally different. In JavaScript, numbers and strings are compared by their content:
Thanks to this fix, the chat no longer re-connects if you edit the input:
However, it does re-connect when you change the roomId dropdown, as you would expect.
This works for functions, too:
You can write your own functions to group pieces of logic inside your Effect. As long as you also declare them inside your Effect, they’re not reactive values, and so they don’t need to be dependencies of your Effect.
Sometimes, you may receive an object from props:
The risk here is that the parent component will create the object during rendering:
This would cause your Effect to re-connect every time the parent component re-renders. To fix this, read information from the object outside the Effect, and avoid having object and function dependencies:
The logic gets a little repetitive (you read some values from an object outside an Effect, and then create an object with the same values inside the Effect). But it makes it very explicit what information your Effect actually depends on. If an object is re-created unintentionally by the parent component, the chat would not re-connect. However, if options.roomId or options.serverUrl really are different, the chat would re-connect.
The same approach can work for functions. For example, suppose the parent component passes a function:
To avoid making it a dependency (and causing it to re-connect on re-renders), call it outside the Effect. This gives you the roomId and serverUrl values that aren’t objects, and that you can read from inside your Effect:
This only works for pure functions because they are safe to call during rendering. If your function is an event handler, but you don’t want its changes to re-synchronize your Effect, wrap it into an Effect Event instead.
Dependencies should always match the code.
When you’re not happy with your dependencies, what you need to edit is the code.
Suppressing the linter leads to very confusing bugs, and you should always avoid it.
To remove a dependency, you need to “prove” to the linter that it’s not necessary.
If some code should run in response to a specific interaction, move that code to an event handler.
If different parts of your Effect should re-run for different reasons, split it into several Effects.
If you want to update some state based on the previous state, pass an updater function.
If you want to read the latest value without “reacting” it, extract an Effect Event from your Effect.
In JavaScript, objects and functions are considered different if they were created at different times.
Try to avoid object and function dependencies. Move them outside the component or inside the Effect.
This Effect sets up an interval that ticks every second. You’ve noticed something strange happening: it seems like the interval gets destroyed and re-created every time it ticks. Fix the code so that the interval doesn’t get constantly re-created.

# Challenge 1 of 5: Extract a useCounter Hook

React comes with several built-in Hooks like useState, useContext, and useEffect. Sometimes, you’ll wish that there was a Hook for some more specific purpose: for example, to fetch data, to keep track of whether the user is online, or to connect to a chat room. You might not find these Hooks in React, but you can create your own Hooks for your application’s needs.
What custom Hooks are, and how to write your own
How to reuse logic between components
How to name and structure your custom Hooks
When and why to extract custom Hooks
Imagine you’re developing an app that heavily relies on the network (as most apps do). You want to warn the user if their network connection has accidentally gone off while they were using your app. How would you go about it? It seems like you’ll need two things in your component:
A piece of state that tracks whether the network is online.
An Effect that subscribes to the global online and offline events, and updates that state.
This will keep your component synchronized with the network status. You might start with something like this:
Try turning your network on and off, and notice how this StatusBar updates in response to your actions.
Now imagine you also want to use the same logic in a different component. You want to implement a Save button that will become disabled and show “Reconnecting…” instead of “Save” while the network is off.
To start, you can copy and paste the isOnline state and the Effect into SaveButton:
Verify that, if you turn off the network, the button will change its appearance.
These two components work fine, but the duplication in logic between them is unfortunate. It seems like even though they have different visual appearance, you want to reuse the logic between them.
Imagine for a moment that, similar to useState and useEffect, there was a built-in useOnlineStatus Hook. Then both of these components could be simplified and you could remove the duplication between them:
Although there is no such built-in Hook, you can write it yourself. Declare a function called useOnlineStatus and move all the duplicated code into it from the components you wrote earlier:
At the end of the function, return isOnline. This lets your components read that value:
Verify that switching the network on and off updates both components.
Now your components don’t have as much repetitive logic. More importantly, the code inside them describes what they want to do (use the online status!) rather than how to do it (by subscribing to the browser events).
When you extract logic into custom Hooks, you can hide the gnarly details of how you deal with some external system or a browser API. The code of your components expresses your intent, not the implementation.
React applications are built from components. Components are built from Hooks, whether built-in or custom. You’ll likely often use custom Hooks created by others, but occasionally you might write one yourself!
You must follow these naming conventions:
React component names must start with a capital letter, like StatusBar and SaveButton. React components also need to return something that React knows how to display, like a piece of JSX.
Hook names must start with use followed by a capital letter, like useState (built-in) or useOnlineStatus (custom, like earlier on the page). Hooks may return arbitrary values.
This convention guarantees that you can always look at a component and know where its state, Effects, and other React features might “hide”. For example, if you see a getColor() function call inside your component, you can be sure that it can’t possibly contain React state inside because its name doesn’t start with use. However, a function call like useOnlineStatus() will most likely contain calls to other Hooks inside!
If your linter is configured for React, it will enforce this naming convention. Scroll up to the sandbox above and rename useOnlineStatus to getOnlineStatus. Notice that the linter won’t allow you to call useState or useEffect inside of it anymore. Only Hooks and components can call other Hooks!






In the earlier example, when you turned the network on and off, both components updated together. However, it’s wrong to think that a single isOnline state variable is shared between them. Look at this code:
It works the same way as before you extracted the duplication:
These are two completely independent state variables and Effects! They happened to have the same value at the same time because you synchronized them with the same external value (whether the network is on).
To better illustrate this, we’ll need a different example. Consider this Form component:
There’s some repetitive logic for each form field:
There’s a piece of state (firstName and lastName).
There’s a change handler (handleFirstNameChange and handleLastNameChange).
There’s a piece of JSX that specifies the value and onChange attributes for that input.
You can extract the repetitive logic into this useFormInput custom Hook:
Notice that it only declares one state variable called value.
However, the Form component calls useFormInput two times:
This is why it works like declaring two separate state variables!
Custom Hooks let you share stateful logic but not state itself. Each call to a Hook is completely independent from every other call to the same Hook. This is why the two sandboxes above are completely equivalent. If you’d like, scroll back up and compare them. The behavior before and after extracting a custom Hook is identical.
When you need to share the state itself between multiple components, lift it up and pass it down instead.
The code inside your custom Hooks will re-run during every re-render of your component. This is why, like components, custom Hooks need to be pure. Think of custom Hooks’ code as part of your component’s body!
Because custom Hooks re-render together with your component, they always receive the latest props and state. To see what this means, consider this chat room example. Change the server URL or the chat room:
When you change serverUrl or roomId, the Effect “reacts” to your changes and re-synchronizes. You can tell by the console messages that the chat re-connects every time that you change your Effect’s dependencies.
Now move the Effect’s code into a custom Hook:
This lets your ChatRoom component call your custom Hook without worrying about how it works inside:
This looks much simpler! (But it does the same thing.)
Notice that the logic still responds to prop and state changes. Try editing the server URL or the selected room:
Notice how you’re taking the return value of one Hook:
and pass it as an input to another Hook:
Every time your ChatRoom component re-renders, it passes the latest roomId and serverUrl to your Hook. This is why your Effect re-connects to the chat whenever their values are different after a re-render. (If you ever worked with audio or video processing software, chaining Hooks like this might remind you of chaining visual or audio effects. It’s as if the output of useState “feeds into” the input of the useChatRoom.)
This section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React.
As you start using useChatRoom in more components, you might want to let components customize its behavior. For example, currently, the logic for what to do when a message arrives is hardcoded inside the Hook:
Let’s say you want to move this logic back to your component:
To make this work, change your custom Hook to take onReceiveMessage as one of its named options:
This will work, but there’s one more improvement you can do when your custom Hook accepts event handlers.
Adding a dependency on onReceiveMessage is not ideal because it will cause the chat to re-connect every time the component re-renders. Wrap this event handler into an Effect Event to remove it from the dependencies:
Now the chat won’t re-connect every time that the ChatRoom component re-renders. Here is a fully working demo of passing an event handler to a custom Hook that you can play with:
Notice how you no longer need to know how useChatRoom works in order to use it. You could add it to any other component, pass any other options, and it would work the same way. That’s the power of custom Hooks.
You don’t need to extract a custom Hook for every little duplicated bit of code. Some duplication is fine. For example, extracting a useFormInput Hook to wrap a single useState call like earlier is probably unnecessary.
However, whenever you write an Effect, consider whether it would be clearer to also wrap it in a custom Hook. You shouldn’t need Effects very often, so if you’re writing one, it means that you need to “step outside React” to synchronize with some external system or to do something that React doesn’t have a built-in API for. Wrapping it into a custom Hook lets you precisely communicate your intent and how the data flows through it.
For example, consider a ShippingForm component that displays two dropdowns: one shows the list of cities, and another shows the list of areas in the selected city. You might start with some code that looks like this:
Although this code is quite repetitive, it’s correct to keep these Effects separate from each other. They synchronize two different things, so you shouldn’t merge them into one Effect. Instead, you can simplify the ShippingForm component above by extracting the common logic between them into your own useData Hook:
Now you can replace both Effects in the ShippingForm components with calls to useData:
Extracting a custom Hook makes the data flow explicit. You feed the url in and you get the data out. By “hiding” your Effect inside useData, you also prevent someone working on the ShippingForm component from adding unnecessary dependencies to it. With time, most of your app’s Effects will be in custom Hooks.


















Effects are an “escape hatch”: you use them when you need to “step outside React” and when there is no better built-in solution for your use case. With time, the React team’s goal is to reduce the number of the Effects in your app to the minimum by providing more specific solutions to more specific problems. Wrapping your Effects in custom Hooks makes it easier to upgrade your code when these solutions become available.
Let’s return to this example:
In the above example, useOnlineStatus is implemented with a pair of useState and useEffect. However, this isn’t the best possible solution. There is a number of edge cases it doesn’t consider. For example, it assumes that when the component mounts, isOnline is already true, but this may be wrong if the network already went offline. You can use the browser navigator.onLine API to check for that, but using it directly would not work on the server for generating the initial HTML. In short, this code could be improved.
Luckily, React 18 includes a dedicated API called useSyncExternalStore which takes care of all of these problems for you. Here is how your useOnlineStatus Hook, rewritten to take advantage of this new API:
Notice how you didn’t need to change any of the components to make this migration:
This is another reason for why wrapping Effects in custom Hooks is often beneficial:
You make the data flow to and from your Effects very explicit.
You let your components focus on the intent rather than on the exact implementation of your Effects.
When React adds new features, you can remove those Effects without changing any of your components.
Similar to a design system, you might find it helpful to start extracting common idioms from your app’s components into custom Hooks. This will keep your components’ code focused on the intent, and let you avoid writing raw Effects very often. Many excellent custom Hooks are maintained by the React community.


Let’s say you want to implement a fade-in animation from scratch using the browser requestAnimationFrame API. You might start with an Effect that sets up an animation loop. During each frame of the animation, you could change the opacity of the DOM node you hold in a ref until it reaches 1. Your code might start like this:
To make the component more readable, you might extract the logic into a useFadeIn custom Hook:
You could keep the useFadeIn code as is, but you could also refactor it more. For example, you could extract the logic for setting up the animation loop out of useFadeIn into a custom useAnimationLoop Hook:
However, you didn’t have to do that. As with regular functions, ultimately you decide where to draw the boundaries between different parts of your code. You could also take a very different approach. Instead of keeping the logic in the Effect, you could move most of the imperative logic inside a JavaScript class:
Effects let you connect React to external systems. The more coordination between Effects is needed (for example, to chain multiple animations), the more it makes sense to extract that logic out of Effects and Hooks completely like in the sandbox above. Then, the code you extracted becomes the “external system”. This lets your Effects stay simple because they only need to send messages to the system you’ve moved outside React.
The examples above assume that the fade-in logic needs to be written in JavaScript. However, this particular fade-in animation is both simpler and much more efficient to implement with a plain CSS Animation:
Sometimes, you don’t even need a Hook!
Custom Hooks let you share logic between components.
Custom Hooks must be named starting with use followed by a capital letter.
Custom Hooks only share stateful logic, not state itself.
You can pass reactive values from one Hook to another, and they stay up-to-date.
All Hooks re-run every time your component re-renders.
The code of your custom Hooks should be pure, like your component’s code.
Wrap event handlers received by custom Hooks into Effect Events.
Don’t create custom Hooks like useMount. Keep their purpose specific.
It’s up to you how and where to choose the boundaries of your code.
This component uses a state variable and an Effect to display a number that increments every second. Extract this logic into a custom Hook called useCounter. Your goal is to make the Counter component implementation look exactly like this:
You’ll need to write your custom Hook in useCounter.js and import it into the App.js file.

```
function StatusBar() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;
}

function SaveButton() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();

  function handleSaveClick() {
    console.log('✅ Progress saved');
  }

  return (
    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>
      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}
    </button>

# React Reference Overview


# React


# React DOM


# Rules of React


# Legacy APIs

This section provides detailed reference documentation for working with React. For an introduction to React, please visit the Learn section.
The React reference documentation is broken down into functional subsections:
Programmatic React features:
Hooks - Use different React features from your components.
Components - Built-in components that you can use in your JSX.
APIs - APIs that are useful for defining components.
Directives - Provide instructions to bundlers compatible with React Server Components.
React-dom contains features that are only supported for web applications (which run in the browser DOM environment). This section is broken into the following:
Hooks - Hooks for web applications which run in the browser DOM environment.
Components - React supports all of the browser built-in HTML and SVG components.
APIs - The react-dom package contains methods supported only in web applications.
Client APIs - The react-dom/client APIs let you render React components on the client (in the browser).
Server APIs - The react-dom/server APIs let you render React components to HTML on the server.
React has idioms — or rules — for how to express patterns in a way that is easy to understand and yields high-quality applications:
Components and Hooks must be pure – Purity makes your code easier to understand, debug, and allows React to automatically optimize your components and hooks correctly.
React calls Components and Hooks – React is responsible for rendering components and hooks when necessary to optimize the user experience.
Rules of Hooks – Hooks are defined using JavaScript functions, but they represent a special type of reusable UI logic with restrictions on where they can be called.
Legacy APIs - Exported from the react package, but not recommended for use in newly written code.""""""",351,1898,react

# Built-in React Hooks


# State Hooks


# Context Hooks


# Ref Hooks


# Effect Hooks


# Performance Hooks


# Other Hooks


# Your own Hooks

Hooks let you use different React features from your components. You can either use the built-in Hooks or combine them to build your own. This page lists all built-in Hooks in React.
State lets a component “remember” information like user input. For example, a form component can use state to store the input value, while an image gallery component can use state to store the selected image index.
To add state to a component, use one of these Hooks:
useState declares a state variable that you can update directly.
useReducer declares a state variable with the update logic inside a reducer function.
Context lets a component receive information from distant parents without passing it as props. For example, your app’s top-level component can pass the current UI theme to all components below, no matter how deep.
useContext reads and subscribes to a context.
Refs let a component hold some information that isn’t used for rendering, like a DOM node or a timeout ID. Unlike with state, updating a ref does not re-render your component. Refs are an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm. They are useful when you need to work with non-React systems, such as the built-in browser APIs.
useRef declares a ref. You can hold any value in it, but most often it’s used to hold a DOM node.
useImperativeHandle lets you customize the ref exposed by your component. This is rarely used.
Effects let a component connect to and synchronize with external systems. This includes dealing with network, browser DOM, animations, widgets written using a different UI library, and other non-React code.
useEffect connects a component to an external system.
Effects are an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm. Don’t use Effects to orchestrate the data flow of your application. If you’re not interacting with an external system, you might not need an Effect.
There are two rarely used variations of useEffect with differences in timing:
useLayoutEffect fires before the browser repaints the screen. You can measure layout here.
useInsertionEffect fires before React makes changes to the DOM. Libraries can insert dynamic CSS here.
A common way to optimize re-rendering performance is to skip unnecessary work. For example, you can tell React to reuse a cached calculation or to skip a re-render if the data has not changed since the previous render.
To skip calculations and unnecessary re-rendering, use one of these Hooks:
useMemo lets you cache the result of an expensive calculation.
useCallback lets you cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component.
Sometimes, you can’t skip re-rendering because the screen actually needs to update. In that case, you can improve performance by separating blocking updates that must be synchronous (like typing into an input) from non-blocking updates which don’t need to block the user interface (like updating a chart).
To prioritize rendering, use one of these Hooks:
useTransition lets you mark a state transition as non-blocking and allow other updates to interrupt it.
useDeferredValue lets you defer updating a non-critical part of the UI and let other parts update first.
These Hooks are mostly useful to library authors and aren’t commonly used in the application code.
useDebugValue lets you customize the label React DevTools displays for your custom Hook.
useId lets a component associate a unique ID with itself. Typically used with accessibility APIs.
useSyncExternalStore lets a component subscribe to an external store.
useActionState allows you to manage state of actions.
You can also define your own custom Hooks as JavaScript functions.

  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

The useActionState Hook is currently only available in React’s Canary and experimental channels. Learn more about release channels here. In addition, you need to use a framework that supports React Server Components to get the full benefit of useActionState.
In earlier React Canary versions, this API was part of React DOM and called useFormState.
useActionState is a Hook that allows you to update state based on the result of a form action.
Reference
useActionState(action, initialState, permalink?)
useActionState(action, initialState, permalink?)
Usage
Using information returned by a form action
Using information returned by a form action
Troubleshooting
My action can no longer read the submitted form data
My action can no longer read the submitted form data
Call useActionState at the top level of your component to create component state that is updated when a form action is invoked. You pass useActionState an existing form action function as well as an initial state, and it returns a new action that you use in your form, along with the latest form state and whether the Action is still pending. The latest form state is also passed to the function that you provided.
The form state is the value returned by the action when the form was last submitted. If the form has not yet been submitted, it is the initial state that you pass.
If used with a Server Action, useActionState allows the server’s response from submitting the form to be shown even before hydration has completed.
See more examples below.
fn: The function to be called when the form is submitted or button pressed. When the function is called, it will receive the previous state of the form (initially the initialState that you pass, subsequently its previous return value) as its initial argument, followed by the arguments that a form action normally receives.
initialState: The value you want the state to be initially. It can be any serializable value. This argument is ignored after the action is first invoked.
optional permalink: A string containing the unique page URL that this form modifies. For use on pages with dynamic content (eg: feeds) in conjunction with progressive enhancement: if fn is a server action and the form is submitted before the JavaScript bundle loads, the browser will navigate to the specified permalink URL, rather than the current page’s URL. Ensure that the same form component is rendered on the destination page (including the same action fn and permalink) so that React knows how to pass the state through. Once the form has been hydrated, this parameter has no effect.
useActionState returns an array with the following values:
The current state. During the first render, it will match the initialState you have passed. After the action is invoked, it will match the value returned by the action.
A new action that you can pass as the action prop to your form component or formAction prop to any button component within the form.
The isPending flag that tells you whether there is a pending Transition.
When used with a framework that supports React Server Components, useActionState lets you make forms interactive before JavaScript has executed on the client. When used without Server Components, it is equivalent to component local state.
The function passed to useActionState receives an extra argument, the previous or initial state, as its first argument. This makes its signature different than if it were used directly as a form action without using useActionState.
Call useActionState at the top level of your component to access the return value of an action from the last time a form was submitted.
useActionState returns an array with the following items:
The current state of the form, which is initially set to the initial state you provided, and after the form is submitted is set to the return value of the action you provided.
A new action that you pass to <form> as its action prop.
A pending state that you can utilise whilst your action is processing.
When the form is submitted, the action function that you provided will be called. Its return value will become the new current state of the form.
The action that you provide will also receive a new first argument, namely the current state of the form. The first time the form is submitted, this will be the initial state you provided, while with subsequent submissions, it will be the return value from the last time the action was called. The rest of the arguments are the same as if useActionState had not been used.
To display messages such as an error message or toast that’s returned by a Server Action, wrap the action in a call to useActionState.
When you wrap an action with useActionState, it gets an extra argument as its first argument. The submitted form data is therefore its second argument instead of its first as it would usually be. The new first argument that gets added is the current state of the form.

```
const [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(fn, initialState, permalink?);
```


```
import { useActionState } from ""react"";

async function increment(previousState, formData) {
  return previousState + 1;
}

function StatefulForm({}) {
  const [state, formAction] = useActionState(increment, 0);
  return (
    <form>
      {state}
      <button formAction={formAction}>Increment</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```


```
import { useActionState } from 'react';
import { action } from './actions.js';

function MyComponent() {
  const [state, formAction] = useActionState(action, null);
  // ...
  return (
    <form action={formAction}>
      {/* ... */}
    </form>
  );
}
```


```
function action(currentState, formData) {
  // ...
  return 'next state';
}
```

function action(currentState, formData) {
  // ...

Call useCallback at the top level of your component to cache a function definition between re-renders:
See more examples below.
fn: The function value that you want to cache. It can take any arguments and return any values. React will return (not call!) your function back to you during the initial render. On next renders, React will give you the same function again if the dependencies have not changed since the last render. Otherwise, it will give you the function that you have passed during the current render, and store it in case it can be reused later. React will not call your function. The function is returned to you so you can decide when and whether to call it.

Otherwise, it will give you the function that you have passed during the current render, and store it in case it can be reused later. React will not call your function. The function is returned to you so you can decide when and whether to call it.
dependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the fn code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison algorithm.

The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison algorithm.
On the initial render, useCallback returns the fn function you have passed.
During subsequent renders, it will either return an already stored fn  function from the last render (if the dependencies haven’t changed), or return the fn function you have passed during this render.
useCallback is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.
React will not throw away the cached function unless there is a specific reason to do that. For example, in development, React throws away the cache when you edit the file of your component. Both in development and in production, React will throw away the cache if your component suspends during the initial mount. In the future, React may add more features that take advantage of throwing away the cache—for example, if React adds built-in support for virtualized lists in the future, it would make sense to throw away the cache for items that scroll out of the virtualized table viewport. This should match your expectations if you rely on useCallback as a performance optimization. Otherwise, a state variable or a ref may be more appropriate.
When you optimize rendering performance, you will sometimes need to cache the functions that you pass to child components. Let’s first look at the syntax for how to do this, and then see in which cases it’s useful.
To cache a function between re-renders of your component, wrap its definition into the useCallback Hook:
You need to pass two things to useCallback:
A function definition that you want to cache between re-renders.
A list of dependencies including every value within your component that’s used inside your function.
On the initial render, the returned function you’ll get from useCallback will be the function you passed.
On the following renders, React will compare the dependencies with the dependencies you passed during the previous render. If none of the dependencies have changed (compared with Object.is), useCallback will return the same function as before. Otherwise, useCallback will return the function you passed on this render.
In other words, useCallback caches a function between re-renders until its dependencies change.
Let’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.
Say you’re passing a handleSubmit function down from the ProductPage to the ShippingForm component:
You’ve noticed that toggling the theme prop freezes the app for a moment, but if you remove <ShippingForm /> from your JSX, it feels fast. This tells you that it’s worth trying to optimize the ShippingForm component.
By default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively. This is why, when ProductPage re-renders with a different theme, the ShippingForm component also re-renders. This is fine for components that don’t require much calculation to re-render. But if you verified a re-render is slow, you can tell ShippingForm to skip re-rendering when its props are the same as on last render by wrapping it in memo:
With this change, ShippingForm will skip re-rendering if all of its props are the same as on the last render. This is when caching a function becomes important! Let’s say you defined handleSubmit without useCallback:
In JavaScript, a function () {} or () => {} always creates a different function, similar to how the {} object literal always creates a new object. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, but it means that ShippingForm props will never be the same, and your memo optimization won’t work. This is where useCallback comes in handy:
By wrapping handleSubmit in useCallback, you ensure that it’s the same function between the re-renders (until dependencies change). You don’t have to wrap a function in useCallback unless you do it for some specific reason. In this example, the reason is that you pass it to a component wrapped in memo, and this lets it skip re-rendering. There are other reasons you might need useCallback which are described further on this page.
You should only rely on useCallback as a performance optimization. If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add useCallback back.



















In this example, the ShippingForm component is artificially slowed down so that you can see what happens when a React component you’re rendering is genuinely slow. Try incrementing the counter and toggling the theme.
Incrementing the counter feels slow because it forces the slowed down ShippingForm to re-render. That’s expected because the counter has changed, and so you need to reflect the user’s new choice on the screen.
Next, try toggling the theme. Thanks to useCallback together with memo, it’s fast despite the artificial slowdown! ShippingForm skipped re-rendering because the handleSubmit function has not changed. The handleSubmit function has not changed because both productId and referrer (your useCallback dependencies) haven’t changed since last render.
Sometimes, you might need to update state based on previous state from a memoized callback.
This handleAddTodo function specifies todos as a dependency because it computes the next todos from it:
You’ll usually want memoized functions to have as few dependencies as possible. When you read some state only to calculate the next state, you can remove that dependency by passing an updater function instead:
Here, instead of making todos a dependency and reading it inside, you pass an instruction about how to update the state (todos => [...todos, newTodo]) to React. Read more about updater functions.
Sometimes, you might want to call a function from inside an Effect:
This creates a problem. Every reactive value must be declared as a dependency of your Effect. However, if you declare createOptions as a dependency, it will cause your Effect to constantly reconnect to the chat room:
To solve this, you can wrap the function you need to call from an Effect into useCallback:
This ensures that the createOptions function is the same between re-renders if the roomId is the same. However, it’s even better to remove the need for a function dependency. Move your function inside the Effect:
Now your code is simpler and doesn’t need useCallback. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.
If you’re writing a custom Hook, it’s recommended to wrap any functions that it returns into useCallback:
This ensures that the consumers of your Hook can optimize their own code when needed.
Make sure you’ve specified the dependency array as a second argument!
If you forget the dependency array, useCallback will return a new function every time:
This is the corrected version passing the dependency array as a second argument:
If this doesn’t help, then the problem is that at least one of your dependencies is different from the previous render. You can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:
You can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select “Store as a global variable” for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as temp1 and the second one got saved as temp2, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:
When you find which dependency is breaking memoization, either find a way to remove it, or memoize it as well.
Suppose the Chart component is wrapped in memo. You want to skip re-rendering every Chart in the list when the ReportList component re-renders. However, you can’t call useCallback in a loop:
Instead, extract a component for an individual item, and put useCallback there:
Alternatively, you could remove useCallback in the last snippet and instead wrap Report itself in memo. If the item prop does not change, Report will skip re-rendering, so Chart will skip re-rendering too:

```
const cachedFn = useCallback(fn, dependencies)

Call useContext at the top level of your component to read and subscribe to context.
See more examples below.
SomeContext: The context that you’ve previously created with createContext. The context itself does not hold the information, it only represents the kind of information you can provide or read from components.
useContext returns the context value for the calling component. It is determined as the value passed to the closest SomeContext.Provider above the calling component in the tree. If there is no such provider, then the returned value will be the defaultValue you have passed to createContext for that context. The returned value is always up-to-date. React automatically re-renders components that read some context if it changes.
useContext() call in a component is not affected by providers returned from the same component. The corresponding <Context.Provider> needs to be above the component doing the useContext() call.
React automatically re-renders all the children that use a particular context starting from the provider that receives a different value. The previous and the next values are compared with the Object.is comparison. Skipping re-renders with memo does not prevent the children receiving fresh context values.
If your build system produces duplicates modules in the output (which can happen with symlinks), this can break context. Passing something via context only works if SomeContext that you use to provide context and SomeContext that you use to read it are exactly the same object, as determined by a === comparison.
Call useContext at the top level of your component to read and subscribe to context.
useContext returns the context value for the context you passed. To determine the context value, React searches the component tree and finds the closest context provider above for that particular context.
To pass context to a Button, wrap it or one of its parent components into the corresponding context provider:
It doesn’t matter how many layers of components there are between the provider and the Button. When a Button anywhere inside of Form calls useContext(ThemeContext), it will receive ""dark"" as the value.
useContext() always looks for the closest provider above the component that calls it. It searches upwards and does not consider providers in the component from which you’re calling useContext().
Often, you’ll want the context to change over time. To update context, combine it with state. Declare a state variable in the parent component, and pass the current state down as the context value to the provider.
Now any Button inside of the provider will receive the current theme value. If you call setTheme to update the theme value that you pass to the provider, all Button components will re-render with the new 'light' value.
In this example, the MyApp component holds a state variable which is then passed to the ThemeContext provider. Checking the “Dark mode” checkbox updates the state. Changing the provided value re-renders all the components using that context.
Note that value=""dark"" passes the ""dark"" string, but value={theme} passes the value of the JavaScript theme variable with JSX curly braces. Curly braces also let you pass context values that aren’t strings.
If React can’t find any providers of that particular context in the parent tree, the context value returned by useContext() will be equal to the default value that you specified when you created that context:
The default value never changes. If you want to update context, use it with state as described above.
Often, instead of null, there is some more meaningful value you can use as a default, for example:
This way, if you accidentally render some component without a corresponding provider, it won’t break. This also helps your components work well in a test environment without setting up a lot of providers in the tests.
In the example below, the “Toggle theme” button is always light because it’s outside any theme context provider and the default context theme value is 'light'. Try editing the default theme to be 'dark'.
You can override the context for a part of the tree by wrapping that part in a provider with a different value.
You can nest and override providers as many times as you need.
Here, the button inside the Footer receives a different context value (""light"") than the buttons outside (""dark"").
You can pass any values via context, including objects and functions.
Here, the context value is a JavaScript object with two properties, one of which is a function. Whenever MyApp re-renders (for example, on a route update), this will be a different object pointing at a different function, so React will also have to re-render all components deep in the tree that call useContext(AuthContext).
In smaller apps, this is not a problem. However, there is no need to re-render them if the underlying data, like currentUser, has not changed. To help React take advantage of that fact, you may wrap the login function with useCallback and wrap the object creation into useMemo. This is a performance optimization:
As a result of this change, even if MyApp needs to re-render, the components calling useContext(AuthContext) won’t need to re-render unless currentUser has changed.
Read more about useMemo and useCallback.
There are a few common ways that this can happen:
You’re rendering <SomeContext.Provider> in the same component (or below) as where you’re calling useContext(). Move <SomeContext.Provider> above and outside the component calling useContext().
You may have forgotten to wrap your component with <SomeContext.Provider>, or you might have put it in a different part of the tree than you thought. Check whether the hierarchy is right using React DevTools.
You might be running into some build issue with your tooling that causes SomeContext as seen from the providing component and SomeContext as seen by the reading component to be two different objects. This can happen if you use symlinks, for example. You can verify this by assigning them to globals like window.SomeContext1 and window.SomeContext2 and then checking whether window.SomeContext1 === window.SomeContext2 in the console. If they’re not the same, fix that issue on the build tool level.
You might have a provider without a value in the tree:
If you forget to specify value, it’s like passing value={undefined}.
You may have also mistakingly used a different prop name by mistake:
In both of these cases you should see a warning from React in the console. To fix them, call the prop value:
Note that the default value from your createContext(defaultValue) call is only used if there is no matching provider above at all. If there is a <SomeContext.Provider value={undefined}> component somewhere in the parent tree, the component calling useContext(SomeContext) will receive undefined as the context value.

Usage

Deferring formatting of a debug value
Adding a label to a custom Hook
Deferring formatting of a debug value
Call useDebugValue at the top level of your custom Hook to display a readable debug value:
See more examples below.
value: The value you want to display in React DevTools. It can have any type.
optional format: A formatting function. When the component is inspected, React DevTools will call the formatting function with the value as the argument, and then display the returned formatted value (which may have any type). If you don’t specify the formatting function, the original value itself will be displayed.
useDebugValue does not return anything.
Call useDebugValue at the top level of your custom Hook to display a readable debug value for React DevTools.
This gives components calling useOnlineStatus a label like OnlineStatus: ""Online"" when you inspect them:
Without the useDebugValue call, only the underlying data (in this example, true) would be displayed.
Don’t add debug values to every custom Hook. It’s most valuable for custom Hooks that are part of shared libraries and that have a complex internal data structure that’s difficult to inspect.
You can also pass a formatting function as the second argument to useDebugValue:
Your formatting function will receive the debug value as a parameter and should return a formatted display value. When your component is inspected, React DevTools will call this function and display its result.
This lets you avoid running potentially expensive formatting logic unless the component is actually inspected. For example, if date is a Date value, this avoids calling toDateString() on it for every render.

```
useDebugValue(value, format?)
```


```
import { useDebugValue } from 'react';

function useOnlineStatus() {
  // ...
  useDebugValue(isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline');
  // ...
}
```


```
import { useDebugValue } from 'react';

function useOnlineStatus() {
  // ...
  useDebugValue(isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline');
  // ...
}
```


```
useDebugValue(date, date => date.toDateString());

Deferring re-rendering for a part of the UI
Call useDeferredValue at the top level of your component to get a deferred version of that value.
See more examples below.
value: The value you want to defer. It can have any type.
Canary only optional initialValue: A value to use during the initial render of a component. If this option is omitted, useDeferredValue will not defer during the initial render, because there’s no previous version of value that it can render instead.
currentValue: During the initial render, the returned deferred value will be the same as the value you provided. During updates, React will first attempt a re-render with the old value (so it will return the old value), and then try another re-render in the background with the new value (so it will return the updated value).
In the latest React Canary versions, useDeferredValue returns the initialValue on initial render, and schedules a re-render in the background with the value returned.
When an update is inside a Transition, useDeferredValue always returns the new value and does not spawn a deferred render, since the update is already deferred.
When an update is inside a Transition, useDeferredValue always returns the new value and does not spawn a deferred render, since the update is already deferred.
The values you pass to useDeferredValue should either be primitive values (like strings and numbers) or objects created outside of rendering. If you create a new object during rendering and immediately pass it to useDeferredValue, it will be different on every render, causing unnecessary background re-renders.

If you create a new object during rendering and immediately pass it to useDeferredValue, it will be different on every render, causing unnecessary background re-renders.
When useDeferredValue receives a different value (compared with Object.is), in addition to the current render (when it still uses the previous value), it schedules a re-render in the background with the new value. The background re-render is interruptible: if there’s another update to the value, React will restart the background re-render from scratch. For example, if the user is typing into an input faster than a chart receiving its deferred value can re-render, the chart will only re-render after the user stops typing.

Call useDeferredValue at the top level of your component to defer updating some part of your UI.
During the initial render, the deferred value will be the same as the value you provided.
During updates, the deferred value will “lag behind” the latest value. In particular, React will first re-render without updating the deferred value, and then try to re-render with the newly received value in the background.
Let’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.
This example assumes you use a Suspense-enabled data source:
Data fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js
Lazy-loading component code with lazy
Reading the value of a Promise with use
Learn more about Suspense and its limitations.
In this example, the SearchResults component suspends while fetching the search results. Try typing ""a"", waiting for the results, and then editing it to ""ab"". The results for ""a"" get replaced by the loading fallback.
A common alternative UI pattern is to defer updating the list of results and to keep showing the previous results until the new results are ready. Call useDeferredValue to pass a deferred version of the query down:
The query will update immediately, so the input will display the new value. However, the deferredQuery will keep its previous value until the data has loaded, so SearchResults will show the stale results for a bit.
Enter ""a"" in the example below, wait for the results to load, and then edit the input to ""ab"". Notice how instead of the Suspense fallback, you now see the stale result list until the new results have loaded:







In the example above, there is no indication that the result list for the latest query is still loading. This can be confusing to the user if the new results take a while to load. To make it more obvious to the user that the result list does not match the latest query, you can add a visual indication when the stale result list is displayed:
With this change, as soon as you start typing, the stale result list gets slightly dimmed until the new result list loads. You can also add a CSS transition to delay dimming so that it feels gradual, like in the example below:
You can also apply useDeferredValue as a performance optimization. It is useful when a part of your UI is slow to re-render, there’s no easy way to optimize it, and you want to prevent it from blocking the rest of the UI.
Imagine you have a text field and a component (like a chart or a long list) that re-renders on every keystroke:
First, optimize SlowList to skip re-rendering when its props are the same. To do this, wrap it in memo:
However, this only helps if the SlowList props are the same as during the previous render. The problem you’re facing now is that it’s slow when they’re different, and when you actually need to show different visual output.
Concretely, the main performance problem is that whenever you type into the input, the SlowList receives new props, and re-rendering its entire tree makes the typing feel janky. In this case, useDeferredValue lets you prioritize updating the input (which must be fast) over updating the result list (which is allowed to be slower):
This does not make re-rendering of the SlowList faster. However, it tells React that re-rendering the list can be deprioritized so that it doesn’t block the keystrokes. The list will “lag behind” the input and then “catch up”. Like before, React will attempt to update the list as soon as possible, but will not block the user from typing.
In this example, each item in the SlowList component is artificially slowed down so that you can see how useDeferredValue lets you keep the input responsive. Type into the input and notice that typing feels snappy while the list “lags behind” it.
This optimization requires SlowList to be wrapped in memo. This is because whenever the text changes, React needs to be able to re-render the parent component quickly. During that re-render, deferredText still has its previous value, so SlowList is able to skip re-rendering (its props have not changed). Without memo, it would have to re-render anyway, defeating the point of the optimization.

Call useEffect at the top level of your component to declare an Effect:
See more examples below.
setup: The function with your Effect’s logic. Your setup function may also optionally return a cleanup function. When your component is added to the DOM, React will run your setup function. After every re-render with changed dependencies, React will first run the cleanup function (if you provided it) with the old values, and then run your setup function with the new values. After your component is removed from the DOM, React will run your cleanup function.

Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. If you omit this argument, your Effect will re-run after every re-render of the component. See the difference between passing an array of dependencies, an empty array, and no dependencies at all.

useEffect is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.

When Strict Mode is on, React will run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic “mirrors” your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, implement the cleanup function.

If your Effect wasn’t caused by an interaction (like a click), React will generally let the browser paint the updated screen first before running your Effect.

Effects only run on the client. They don’t run during server rendering.
Effects only run on the client. They don’t run during server rendering.
Some components need to stay connected to the network, some browser API, or a third-party library, while they are displayed on the page. These systems aren’t controlled by React, so they are called external.
To connect your component to some external system, call useEffect at the top level of your component:
You need to pass two arguments to useEffect:
A setup function with setup code that connects to that system.
It should return a cleanup function with cleanup code that disconnects from that system.
It should return a cleanup function with cleanup code that disconnects from that system.
A list of dependencies including every value from your component used inside of those functions.
React calls your setup and cleanup functions whenever it’s necessary, which may happen multiple times:
Your setup code runs when your component is added to the page (mounts).
After every re-render of your component where the dependencies have changed:
First, your cleanup code runs with the old props and state.
Then, your setup code runs with the new props and state.
First, your cleanup code runs with the old props and state.
Then, your setup code runs with the new props and state.
Your cleanup code runs one final time after your component is removed from the page (unmounts).
Let’s illustrate this sequence for the example above.
When the ChatRoom component above gets added to the page, it will connect to the chat room with the initial serverUrl and roomId. If either serverUrl or roomId change as a result of a re-render (say, if the user picks a different chat room in a dropdown), your Effect will disconnect from the previous room, and connect to the next one. When the ChatRoom component is removed from the page, your Effect will disconnect one last time.
To help you find bugs, in development React runs setup and cleanup one extra time before the setup. This is a stress-test that verifies your Effect’s logic is implemented correctly. If this causes visible issues, your cleanup function is missing some logic. The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the setup function was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn’t be able to distinguish between the setup being called once (as in production) and a setup → cleanup → setup sequence (as in development). See common solutions.
Try to write every Effect as an independent process and think about a single setup/cleanup cycle at a time. It shouldn’t matter whether your component is mounting, updating, or unmounting. When your cleanup logic correctly “mirrors” the setup logic, your Effect is resilient to running setup and cleanup as often as needed.
An Effect lets you keep your component synchronized with some external system (like a chat service). Here, external system means any piece of code that’s not controlled by React, such as:
A timer managed with setInterval() and clearInterval().
An event subscription using window.addEventListener() and window.removeEventListener().
A third-party animation library with an API like animation.start() and animation.reset().
If you’re not connecting to any external system, you probably don’t need an Effect.
In this example, the ChatRoom component uses an Effect to stay connected to an external system defined in chat.js. Press “Open chat” to make the ChatRoom component appear. This sandbox runs in development mode, so there is an extra connect-and-disconnect cycle, as explained here. Try changing the roomId and serverUrl using the dropdown and the input, and see how the Effect re-connects to the chat. Press “Close chat” to see the Effect disconnect one last time.
Effects are an “escape hatch”: you use them when you need to “step outside React” and when there is no better built-in solution for your use case. If you find yourself often needing to manually write Effects, it’s usually a sign that you need to extract some custom Hooks for common behaviors your components rely on.
For example, this useChatRoom custom Hook “hides” the logic of your Effect behind a more declarative API:
Then you can use it from any component like this:
There are also many excellent custom Hooks for every purpose available in the React ecosystem.
Learn more about wrapping Effects in custom Hooks.
This example is identical to one of the earlier examples, but the logic is extracted to a custom Hook.
Sometimes, you want to keep an external system synchronized to some prop or state of your component.
For example, if you have a third-party map widget or a video player component written without React, you can use an Effect to call methods on it that make its state match the current state of your React component. This Effect creates an instance of a MapWidget class defined in map-widget.js. When you change the zoomLevel prop of the Map component, the Effect calls the setZoom() on the class instance to keep it synchronized:
In this example, a cleanup function is not needed because the MapWidget class manages only the DOM node that was passed to it. After the Map React component is removed from the tree, both the DOM node and the MapWidget class instance will be automatically garbage-collected by the browser JavaScript engine.
You can use an Effect to fetch data for your component. Note that if you use a framework, using your framework’s data fetching mechanism will be a lot more efficient than writing Effects manually.
If you want to fetch data from an Effect manually, your code might look like this:
Note the ignore variable which is initialized to false, and is set to true during cleanup. This ensures your code doesn’t suffer from “race conditions”: network responses may arrive in a different order than you sent them.
You can also rewrite using the async / await syntax, but you still need to provide a cleanup function:
Writing data fetching directly in Effects gets repetitive and makes it difficult to add optimizations like caching and server rendering later. It’s easier to use a custom Hook—either your own or maintained by the community.









Notice that you can’t “choose” the dependencies of your Effect. Every reactive value used by your Effect’s code must be declared as a dependency. Your Effect’s dependency list is determined by the surrounding code:
If either serverUrl or roomId change, your Effect will reconnect to the chat using the new values.
Reactive values include props and all variables and functions declared directly inside of your component. Since roomId and serverUrl are reactive values, you can’t remove them from the dependencies. If you try to omit them and your linter is correctly configured for React, the linter will flag this as a mistake you need to fix:
To remove a dependency, you need to “prove” to the linter that it doesn’t need to be a dependency. For example, you can move serverUrl out of your component to prove that it’s not reactive and won’t change on re-renders:
Now that serverUrl is not a reactive value (and can’t change on a re-render), it doesn’t need to be a dependency. If your Effect’s code doesn’t use any reactive values, its dependency list should be empty ([]):
An Effect with empty dependencies doesn’t re-run when any of your component’s props or state change.
If you have an existing codebase, you might have some Effects that suppress the linter like this:
When dependencies don’t match the code, there is a high risk of introducing bugs. By suppressing the linter, you “lie” to React about the values your Effect depends on. Instead, prove they’re unnecessary.
If you specify the dependencies, your Effect runs after the initial render and after re-renders with changed dependencies.
In the below example, serverUrl and roomId are reactive values, so they both must be specified as dependencies. As a result, selecting a different room in the dropdown or editing the server URL input causes the chat to re-connect. However, since message isn’t used in the Effect (and so it isn’t a dependency), editing the message doesn’t re-connect to the chat.
When you want to update state based on previous state from an Effect, you might run into a problem:
Since count is a reactive value, it must be specified in the list of dependencies. However, that causes the Effect to cleanup and setup again every time the count changes. This is not ideal.
To fix this, pass the c => c + 1 state updater to setCount:
Now that you’re passing c => c + 1 instead of count + 1, your Effect no longer needs to depend on count. As a result of this fix, it won’t need to cleanup and setup the interval again every time the count changes.
If your Effect depends on an object or a function created during rendering, it might run too often. For example, this Effect re-connects after every render because the options object is different for every render:
Avoid using an object created during rendering as a dependency. Instead, create the object inside the Effect:
Now that you create the options object inside the Effect, the Effect itself only depends on the roomId string.
With this fix, typing into the input doesn’t reconnect the chat. Unlike an object which gets re-created, a string like roomId doesn’t change unless you set it to another value. Read more about removing dependencies.
If your Effect depends on an object or a function created during rendering, it might run too often. For example, this Effect re-connects after every render because the createOptions function is different for every render:
By itself, creating a function from scratch on every re-render is not a problem. You don’t need to optimize that. However, if you use it as a dependency of your Effect, it will cause your Effect to re-run after every re-render.
Avoid using a function created during rendering as a dependency. Instead, declare it inside the Effect:
Now that you define the createOptions function inside the Effect, the Effect itself only depends on the roomId string. With this fix, typing into the input doesn’t reconnect the chat. Unlike a function which gets re-created, a string like roomId doesn’t change unless you set it to another value. Read more about removing dependencies.
This section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React.
By default, when you read a reactive value from an Effect, you have to add it as a dependency. This ensures that your Effect “reacts” to every change of that value. For most dependencies, that’s the behavior you want.
However, sometimes you’ll want to read the latest props and state from an Effect without “reacting” to them. For example, imagine you want to log the number of the items in the shopping cart for every page visit:
What if you want to log a new page visit after every url change, but not if only the shoppingCart changes? You can’t exclude shoppingCart from dependencies without breaking the reactivity rules. However, you can express that you don’t want a piece of code to “react” to changes even though it is called from inside an Effect. Declare an Effect Event with the useEffectEvent Hook, and move the code reading shoppingCart inside of it:
Effect Events are not reactive and must always be omitted from dependencies of your Effect. This is what lets you put non-reactive code (where you can read the latest value of some props and state) inside of them. By reading shoppingCart inside of onVisit, you ensure that shoppingCart won’t re-run your Effect.
Read more about how Effect Events let you separate reactive and non-reactive code.
If your app uses server rendering (either directly or via a framework), your component will render in two different environments. On the server, it will render to produce the initial HTML. On the client, React will run the rendering code again so that it can attach your event handlers to that HTML. This is why, for hydration to work, your initial render output must be identical on the client and the server.
In rare cases, you might need to display different content on the client. For example, if your app reads some data from localStorage, it can’t possibly do that on the server. Here is how you could implement this:
While the app is loading, the user will see the initial render output. Then, when it’s loaded and hydrated, your Effect will run and set didMount to true, triggering a re-render. This will switch to the client-only render output. Effects don’t run on the server, so this is why didMount was false during the initial server render.
Use this pattern sparingly. Keep in mind that users with a slow connection will see the initial content for quite a bit of time—potentially, many seconds—so you don’t want to make jarring changes to your component’s appearance. In many cases, you can avoid the need for this by conditionally showing different things with CSS.
When Strict Mode is on, in development, React runs setup and cleanup one extra time before the actual setup.
This is a stress-test that verifies your Effect’s logic is implemented correctly. If this causes visible issues, your cleanup function is missing some logic. The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the setup function was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn’t be able to distinguish between the setup being called once (as in production) and a setup → cleanup → setup sequence (as in development).
Read more about how this helps find bugs and how to fix your logic.
First, check that you haven’t forgotten to specify the dependency array:
If you’ve specified the dependency array but your Effect still re-runs in a loop, it’s because one of your dependencies is different on every re-render.
You can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:
You can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select “Store as a global variable” for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as temp1 and the second one got saved as temp2, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:
When you find the dependency that is different on every re-render, you can usually fix it in one of these ways:
Updating state based on previous state from an Effect
Removing unnecessary object dependencies
Removing unnecessary function dependencies
Reading the latest props and state from an Effect
As a last resort (if these methods didn’t help), wrap its creation with useMemo or useCallback (for functions).
If your Effect runs in an infinite cycle, these two things must be true:
Your Effect is updating some state.
That state leads to a re-render, which causes the Effect’s dependencies to change.
Before you start fixing the problem, ask yourself whether your Effect is connecting to some external system (like DOM, network, a third-party widget, and so on). Why does your Effect need to set state? Does it synchronize with that external system? Or are you trying to manage your application’s data flow with it?
If there is no external system, consider whether removing the Effect altogether would simplify your logic.
If you’re genuinely synchronizing with some external system, think about why and under what conditions your Effect should update the state. Has something changed that affects your component’s visual output? If you need to keep track of some data that isn’t used by rendering, a ref (which doesn’t trigger re-renders) might be more appropriate. Verify your Effect doesn’t update the state (and trigger re-renders) more than needed.
Finally, if your Effect is updating the state at the right time, but there is still a loop, it’s because that state update leads to one of the Effect’s dependencies changing. Read how to debug dependency changes.
The cleanup function runs not only during unmount, but before every re-render with changed dependencies. Additionally, in development, React runs setup+cleanup one extra time immediately after component mounts.
If you have cleanup code without corresponding setup code, it’s usually a code smell:
Your cleanup logic should be “symmetrical” to the setup logic, and should stop or undo whatever setup did:
Learn how the Effect lifecycle is different from the component’s lifecycle.
If your Effect must block the browser from painting the screen, replace useEffect with useLayoutEffect. Note that this shouldn’t be needed for the vast majority of Effects. You’ll only need this if it’s crucial to run your Effect before the browser paint: for example, to measure and position a tooltip before the user sees it.

useId returns a unique ID string associated with this particular useId call in this particular component.
useId is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.

Call useId at the top level of your component to generate a unique ID:
You can then pass the generated ID to different attributes:
Let’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.
HTML accessibility attributes like aria-describedby let you specify that two tags are related to each other. For example, you can specify that an element (like an input) is described by another element (like a paragraph).
In regular HTML, you would write it like this:
However, hardcoding IDs like this is not a good practice in React. A component may be rendered more than once on the page—but IDs have to be unique! Instead of hardcoding an ID, generate a unique ID with useId:
Now, even if PasswordField appears multiple times on the screen, the generated IDs won’t clash.
Watch this video to see the difference in the user experience with assistive technologies.
With server rendering, useId requires an identical component tree on the server and the client. If the trees you render on the server and the client don’t match exactly, the generated IDs won’t match.




If you need to give IDs to multiple related elements, you can call useId to generate a shared prefix for them:
This lets you avoid calling useId for every single element that needs a unique ID.
If you render multiple independent React applications on a single page, pass identifierPrefix as an option to your createRoot or hydrateRoot calls. This ensures that the IDs generated by the two different apps never clash because every identifier generated with useId will start with the distinct prefix you’ve specified.
If you render multiple independent React apps on the same page, and some of these apps are server-rendered, make sure that the identifierPrefix you pass to the hydrateRoot call on the client side is the same as the identifierPrefix you pass to the server APIs such as renderToPipeableStream.
You do not need to pass identifierPrefix if you only have one React app on the page.

useImperativeHandle returns undefined.
By default, components don’t expose their DOM nodes to parent components. For example, if you want the parent component of MyInput to have access to the <input> DOM node, you have to opt in with forwardRef:
With the code above, a ref to MyInput will receive the <input> DOM node. However, you can expose a custom value instead. To customize the exposed handle, call useImperativeHandle at the top level of your component:
Note that in the code above, the ref is no longer forwarded to the <input>.
For example, suppose you don’t want to expose the entire <input> DOM node, but you want to expose two of its methods: focus and scrollIntoView. To do this, keep the real browser DOM in a separate ref. Then use useImperativeHandle to expose a handle with only the methods that you want the parent component to call:
Now, if the parent component gets a ref to MyInput, it will be able to call the focus and scrollIntoView methods on it. However, it will not have full access to the underlying <input> DOM node.
The methods you expose via an imperative handle don’t have to match the DOM methods exactly. For example, this Post component exposes a scrollAndFocusAddComment method via an imperative handle. This lets the parent Page scroll the list of comments and focus the input field when you click the button:
Do not overuse refs. You should only use refs for imperative behaviors that you can’t express as props: for example, scrolling to a node, focusing a node, triggering an animation, selecting text, and so on.
If you can express something as a prop, you should not use a ref. For example, instead of exposing an imperative handle like { open, close } from a Modal component, it is better to take isOpen as a prop like <Modal isOpen={isOpen} />. Effects can help you expose imperative behaviors via props.

# How is this better than injecting styles during rendering or useLayoutEffect?

useInsertionEffect is for CSS-in-JS library authors. Unless you are working on a CSS-in-JS library and need a place to inject the styles, you probably want useEffect or useLayoutEffect instead.
useInsertionEffect allows inserting elements into the DOM before any layout Effects fire.

Call useInsertionEffect to insert styles before any Effects fire that may need to read layout:
See more examples below.
setup: The function with your Effect’s logic. Your setup function may also optionally return a cleanup function. When your component is added to the DOM, but before any layout Effects fire, React will run your setup function. After every re-render with changed dependencies, React will first run the cleanup function (if you provided it) with the old values, and then run your setup function with the new values. When your component is removed from the DOM, React will run your cleanup function.

useInsertionEffect returns undefined.
Effects only run on the client. They don’t run during server rendering.
You can’t update state from inside useInsertionEffect.
By the time useInsertionEffect runs, refs are not attached yet.
useInsertionEffect may run either before or after the DOM has been updated. You shouldn’t rely on the DOM being updated at any particular time.
Unlike other types of Effects, which fire cleanup for every Effect and then setup for every Effect, useInsertionEffect will fire both cleanup and setup one component at a time. This results in an “interleaving” of the cleanup and setup functions.
Traditionally, you would style React components using plain CSS.
Some teams prefer to author styles directly in JavaScript code instead of writing CSS files. This usually requires using a CSS-in-JS library or a tool. There are three common approaches to CSS-in-JS:
Static extraction to CSS files with a compiler
Inline styles, e.g. <div style={{ opacity: 1 }}>
Runtime injection of <style> tags
If you use CSS-in-JS, we recommend a combination of the first two approaches (CSS files for static styles, inline styles for dynamic styles). We don’t recommend runtime <style> tag injection for two reasons:
Runtime injection forces the browser to recalculate the styles a lot more often.
Runtime injection can be very slow if it happens at the wrong time in the React lifecycle.
The first problem is not solvable, but useInsertionEffect helps you solve the second problem.
Call useInsertionEffect to insert the styles before any layout Effects fire:
Similarly to useEffect, useInsertionEffect does not run on the server. If you need to collect which CSS rules have been used on the server, you can do it during rendering:

Call useLayoutEffect to perform the layout measurements before the browser repaints the screen:
See more examples below.
setup: The function with your Effect’s logic. Your setup function may also optionally return a cleanup function. Before your component is added to the DOM, React will run your setup function. After every re-render with changed dependencies, React will first run the cleanup function (if you provided it) with the old values, and then run your setup function with the new values. Before your component is removed from the DOM, React will run your cleanup function.

The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. If you omit this argument, your Effect will re-run after every re-render of the component.

useLayoutEffect is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a component and move the Effect there.

When Strict Mode is on, React will run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic “mirrors” your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, implement the cleanup function.

Most components don’t need to know their position and size on the screen to decide what to render. They only return some JSX. Then the browser calculates their layout (position and size) and repaints the screen.
Sometimes, that’s not enough. Imagine a tooltip that appears next to some element on hover. If there’s enough space, the tooltip should appear above the element, but if it doesn’t fit, it should appear below. In order to render the tooltip at the right final position, you need to know its height (i.e. whether it fits at the top).
To do this, you need to render in two passes:
Render the tooltip anywhere (even with a wrong position).
Measure its height and decide where to place the tooltip.
Render the tooltip again in the correct place.
All of this needs to happen before the browser repaints the screen. You don’t want the user to see the tooltip moving. Call useLayoutEffect to perform the layout measurements before the browser repaints the screen:
Here’s how this works step by step:
Tooltip renders with the initial tooltipHeight = 0 (so the tooltip may be wrongly positioned).
React places it in the DOM and runs the code in useLayoutEffect.
Your useLayoutEffect measures the height of the tooltip content and triggers an immediate re-render.
Tooltip renders again with the real tooltipHeight (so the tooltip is correctly positioned).
React updates it in the DOM, and the browser finally displays the tooltip.
Hover over the buttons below and see how the tooltip adjusts its position depending on whether it fits:
Notice that even though the Tooltip component has to render in two passes (first, with tooltipHeight initialized to 0 and then with the real measured height), you only see the final result. This is why you need useLayoutEffect instead of useEffect for this example. Let’s look at the difference in detail below.
React guarantees that the code inside useLayoutEffect and any state updates scheduled inside it will be processed before the browser repaints the screen. This lets you render the tooltip, measure it, and re-render the tooltip again without the user noticing the first extra render. In other words, useLayoutEffect blocks the browser from painting.
Rendering in two passes and blocking the browser hurts performance. Try to avoid this when you can.
The purpose of useLayoutEffect is to let your component use layout information for rendering:
Render the initial content.
Measure the layout before the browser repaints the screen.
Render the final content using the layout information you’ve read.
When you or your framework uses server rendering, your React app renders to HTML on the server for the initial render. This lets you show the initial HTML before the JavaScript code loads.
The problem is that on the server, there is no layout information.
In the earlier example, the useLayoutEffect call in the Tooltip component lets it position itself correctly (either above or below content) depending on the content height. If you tried to render Tooltip as a part of the initial server HTML, this would be impossible to determine. On the server, there is no layout yet! So, even if you rendered it on the server, its position would “jump” on the client after the JavaScript loads and runs.
Usually, components that rely on layout information don’t need to render on the server anyway. For example, it probably doesn’t make sense to show a Tooltip during the initial render. It is triggered by a client interaction.
However, if you’re running into this problem, you have a few different options:
Replace useLayoutEffect with useEffect. This tells React that it’s okay to display the initial render result without blocking the paint (because the original HTML will become visible before your Effect runs).
Replace useLayoutEffect with useEffect. This tells React that it’s okay to display the initial render result without blocking the paint (because the original HTML will become visible before your Effect runs).
Alternatively, mark your component as client-only. This tells React to replace its content up to the closest <Suspense> boundary with a loading fallback (for example, a spinner or a glimmer) during server rendering.

Alternatively, you can render a component with useLayoutEffect only after hydration. Keep a boolean isMounted state that’s initialized to false, and set it to true inside a useEffect call. Your rendering logic can then be like return isMounted ? <RealContent /> : <FallbackContent />. On the server and during the hydration, the user will see FallbackContent which should not call useLayoutEffect. Then React will replace it with RealContent which runs on the client only and can include useLayoutEffect calls.

Call useMemo at the top level of your component to cache a calculation between re-renders:
See more examples below.
calculateValue: The function calculating the value that you want to cache. It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value of any type. React will call your function during the initial render. On next renders, React will return the same value again if the dependencies have not changed since the last render. Otherwise, it will call calculateValue, return its result, and store it so it can be reused later.

Otherwise, it will call calculateValue, return its result, and store it so it can be reused later.
dependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the calculateValue code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison.

The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison.
On the initial render, useMemo returns the result of calling calculateValue with no arguments.
During next renders, it will either return an already stored value from the last render (if the dependencies haven’t changed), or call calculateValue again, and return the result that calculateValue has returned.
useMemo is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.
In Strict Mode, React will call your calculation function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your calculation function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect your logic. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.
React will not throw away the cached value unless there is a specific reason to do that. For example, in development, React throws away the cache when you edit the file of your component. Both in development and in production, React will throw away the cache if your component suspends during the initial mount. In the future, React may add more features that take advantage of throwing away the cache—for example, if React adds built-in support for virtualized lists in the future, it would make sense to throw away the cache for items that scroll out of the virtualized table viewport. This should be fine if you rely on useMemo solely as a performance optimization. Otherwise, a state variable or a ref may be more appropriate.
Caching return values like this is also known as memoization, which is why this Hook is called useMemo.
To cache a calculation between re-renders, wrap it in a useMemo call at the top level of your component:
You need to pass two things to useMemo:
A calculation function that takes no arguments, like () =>, and returns what you wanted to calculate.
A list of dependencies including every value within your component that’s used inside your calculation.
On the initial render, the value you’ll get from useMemo will be the result of calling your calculation.
On every subsequent render, React will compare the dependencies with the dependencies you passed during the last render. If none of the dependencies have changed (compared with Object.is), useMemo will return the value you already calculated before. Otherwise, React will re-run your calculation and return the new value.
In other words, useMemo caches a calculation result between re-renders until its dependencies change.
Let’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.
By default, React will re-run the entire body of your component every time that it re-renders. For example, if this TodoList updates its state or receives new props from its parent, the filterTodos function will re-run:
Usually, this isn’t a problem because most calculations are very fast. However, if you’re filtering or transforming a large array, or doing some expensive computation, you might want to skip doing it again if data hasn’t changed. If both todos and tab are the same as they were during the last render, wrapping the calculation in useMemo like earlier lets you reuse visibleTodos you’ve already calculated before.
This type of caching is called memoization.
You should only rely on useMemo as a performance optimization. If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add useMemo to improve performance.


















In this example, the filterTodos implementation is artificially slowed down so that you can see what happens when some JavaScript function you’re calling during rendering is genuinely slow. Try switching the tabs and toggling the theme.
Switching the tabs feels slow because it forces the slowed down filterTodos to re-execute. That’s expected because the tab has changed, and so the entire calculation needs to re-run. (If you’re curious why it runs twice, it’s explained here.)
Toggle the theme. Thanks to useMemo, it’s fast despite the artificial slowdown! The slow filterTodos call was skipped because both todos and tab (which you pass as dependencies to useMemo) haven’t changed since the last render.
In some cases, useMemo can also help you optimize performance of re-rendering child components. To illustrate this, let’s say this TodoList component passes the visibleTodos as a prop to the child List component:
You’ve noticed that toggling the theme prop freezes the app for a moment, but if you remove <List /> from your JSX, it feels fast. This tells you that it’s worth trying to optimize the List component.
By default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively. This is why, when TodoList re-renders with a different theme, the List component also re-renders. This is fine for components that don’t require much calculation to re-render. But if you’ve verified that a re-render is slow, you can tell List to skip re-rendering when its props are the same as on last render by wrapping it in memo:
With this change, List will skip re-rendering if all of its props are the same as on the last render. This is where caching the calculation becomes important! Imagine that you calculated visibleTodos without useMemo:
In the above example, the filterTodos function always creates a different array, similar to how the {} object literal always creates a new object. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, but it means that List props will never be the same, and your memo optimization won’t work. This is where useMemo comes in handy:
By wrapping the visibleTodos calculation in useMemo, you ensure that it has the same value between the re-renders (until dependencies change). You don’t have to wrap a calculation in useMemo unless you do it for some specific reason. In this example, the reason is that you pass it to a component wrapped in memo, and this lets it skip re-rendering. There are a few other reasons to add useMemo which are described further on this page.





In this example, the List component is artificially slowed down so that you can see what happens when a React component you’re rendering is genuinely slow. Try switching the tabs and toggling the theme.
Switching the tabs feels slow because it forces the slowed down List to re-render. That’s expected because the tab has changed, and so you need to reflect the user’s new choice on the screen.
Next, try toggling the theme. Thanks to useMemo together with memo, it’s fast despite the artificial slowdown! The List skipped re-rendering because the visibleTodos array has not changed since the last render. The visibleTodos array has not changed because both todos and tab (which you pass as dependencies to useMemo) haven’t changed since the last render.
Sometimes, you might want to use a value inside an Effect:
This creates a problem. Every reactive value must be declared as a dependency of your Effect. However, if you declare options as a dependency, it will cause your Effect to constantly reconnect to the chat room:
To solve this, you can wrap the object you need to call from an Effect in useMemo:
This ensures that the options object is the same between re-renders if useMemo returns the cached object.
However, since useMemo is performance optimization, not a semantic guarantee, React may throw away the cached value if there is a specific reason to do that. This will also cause the effect to re-fire, so it’s even better to remove the need for a function dependency by moving your object inside the Effect:
Now your code is simpler and doesn’t need useMemo. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.
Suppose you have a calculation that depends on an object created directly in the component body:
Depending on an object like this defeats the point of memoization. When a component re-renders, all of the code directly inside the component body runs again. The lines of code creating the searchOptions object will also run on every re-render. Since searchOptions is a dependency of your useMemo call, and it’s different every time, React knows the dependencies are different, and recalculate searchItems every time.
To fix this, you could memoize the searchOptions object itself before passing it as a dependency:
In the example above, if the text did not change, the searchOptions object also won’t change. However, an even better fix is to move the searchOptions object declaration inside of the useMemo calculation function:
Now your calculation depends on text directly (which is a string and can’t “accidentally” become different).
Suppose the Form component is wrapped in memo. You want to pass a function to it as a prop:
Just as {} creates a different object, function declarations like function() {} and expressions like () => {} produce a different function on every re-render. By itself, creating a new function is not a problem. This is not something to avoid! However, if the Form component is memoized, presumably you want to skip re-rendering it when no props have changed. A prop that is always different would defeat the point of memoization.
To memoize a function with useMemo, your calculation function would have to return another function:
This looks clunky! Memoizing functions is common enough that React has a built-in Hook specifically for that. Wrap your functions into useCallback instead of useMemo to avoid having to write an extra nested function:
The two examples above are completely equivalent. The only benefit to useCallback is that it lets you avoid writing an extra nested function inside. It doesn’t do anything else. Read more about useCallback.
In Strict Mode, React will call some of your functions twice instead of once:
This is expected and shouldn’t break your code.
This development-only behavior helps you keep components pure. React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component and calculation functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice and fix the mistake.
For example, this impure calculation function mutates an array you received as a prop:
React calls your function twice, so you’d notice the todo is added twice. Your calculation shouldn’t change any existing objects, but it’s okay to change any new objects you created during the calculation. For example, if the filterTodos function always returns a different array, you can mutate that array instead:
Read keeping components pure to learn more about purity.
Also, check out the guides on updating objects and updating arrays without mutation.
This code doesn’t work:
In JavaScript, () => { starts the arrow function body, so the { brace is not a part of your object. This is why it doesn’t return an object, and leads to mistakes. You could fix it by adding parentheses like ({ and }):
However, this is still confusing and too easy for someone to break by removing the parentheses.
To avoid this mistake, write a return statement explicitly:
Make sure you’ve specified the dependency array as a second argument!
If you forget the dependency array, useMemo will re-run the calculation every time:
This is the corrected version passing the dependency array as a second argument:
If this doesn’t help, then the problem is that at least one of your dependencies is different from the previous render. You can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:
You can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select “Store as a global variable” for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as temp1 and the second one got saved as temp2, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:
When you find which dependency breaks memoization, either find a way to remove it, or memoize it as well.
Suppose the Chart component is wrapped in memo. You want to skip re-rendering every Chart in the list when the ReportList component re-renders. However, you can’t call useMemo in a loop:
Instead, extract a component for each item and memoize data for individual items:
Alternatively, you could remove useMemo and instead wrap Report itself in memo. If the item prop does not change, Report will skip re-rendering, so Chart will skip re-rendering too:

The useOptimistic Hook is currently only available in React’s Canary and experimental channels. Learn more about React’s release channels here.
useOptimistic is a React Hook that lets you optimistically update the UI.

Optimistically updating forms
Optimistically updating forms
useOptimistic is a React Hook that lets you show a different state while an async action is underway. It accepts some state as an argument and returns a copy of that state that can be different during the duration of an async action such as a network request. You provide a function that takes the current state and the input to the action, and returns the optimistic state to be used while the action is pending.
This state is called the “optimistic” state because it is usually used to immediately present the user with the result of performing an action, even though the action actually takes time to complete.
See more examples below.
state: the value to be returned initially and whenever no action is pending.
updateFn(currentState, optimisticValue): a function that takes the current state and the optimistic value passed to addOptimistic and returns the resulting optimistic state. It must be a pure function. updateFn takes in two parameters. The currentState and the optimisticValue. The return value will be the merged value of the currentState and optimisticValue.
optimisticState: The resulting optimistic state. It is equal to state unless an action is pending, in which case it is equal to the value returned by updateFn.
addOptimistic: addOptimistic is the dispatching function to call when you have an optimistic update. It takes one argument, optimisticValue, of any type and will call the updateFn with state and optimisticValue.
The useOptimistic Hook provides a way to optimistically update the user interface before a background operation, like a network request, completes. In the context of forms, this technique helps to make apps feel more responsive. When a user submits a form, instead of waiting for the server’s response to reflect the changes, the interface is immediately updated with the expected outcome.
For example, when a user types a message into the form and hits the “Send” button, the useOptimistic Hook allows the message to immediately appear in the list with a “Sending…” label, even before the message is actually sent to a server. This “optimistic” approach gives the impression of speed and responsiveness. The form then attempts to truly send the message in the background. Once the server confirms the message has been received, the “Sending…” label is removed.

```
  const [optimisticState, addOptimistic] = useOptimistic(state, updateFn);
```


```
import { useOptimistic } from 'react';

function AppContainer() {
  const [optimisticState, addOptimistic] = useOptimistic(
    state,
    // updateFn
    (currentState, optimisticValue) => {
      // merge and return new state
      // with optimistic value
    }
  );

Call useReducer at the top level of your component to manage its state with a reducer.
See more examples below.
reducer: The reducer function that specifies how the state gets updated. It must be pure, should take the state and action as arguments, and should return the next state. State and action can be of any types.
initialArg: The value from which the initial state is calculated. It can be a value of any type. How the initial state is calculated from it depends on the next init argument.
optional init: The initializer function that should return the initial state. If it’s not specified, the initial state is set to initialArg. Otherwise, the initial state is set to the result of calling init(initialArg).
useReducer returns an array with exactly two values:
The current state. During the first render, it’s set to init(initialArg) or initialArg (if there’s no init).
The dispatch function that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.
useReducer is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.
The dispatch function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.
In Strict Mode, React will call your reducer and initializer twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your reducer and initializer are pure (as they should be), this should not affect your logic. The result from one of the calls is ignored.
The dispatch function returned by useReducer lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render. You need to pass the action as the only argument to the dispatch function:
React will set the next state to the result of calling the reducer function you’ve provided with the current state and the action you’ve passed to dispatch.
action: The action performed by the user. It can be a value of any type. By convention, an action is usually an object with a type property identifying it and, optionally, other properties with additional information.
dispatch functions do not have a return value.
The dispatch function only updates the state variable for the next render. If you read the state variable after calling the dispatch function, you will still get the old value that was on the screen before your call.
The dispatch function only updates the state variable for the next render. If you read the state variable after calling the dispatch function, you will still get the old value that was on the screen before your call.
If the new value you provide is identical to the current state, as determined by an Object.is comparison, React will skip re-rendering the component and its children. This is an optimization. React may still need to call your component before ignoring the result, but it shouldn’t affect your code.

React batches state updates. It updates the screen after all the event handlers have run and have called their set functions. This prevents multiple re-renders during a single event. In the rare case that you need to force React to update the screen earlier, for example to access the DOM, you can use flushSync.

In the rare case that you need to force React to update the screen earlier, for example to access the DOM, you can use flushSync.
Call useReducer at the top level of your component to manage state with a reducer.
useReducer returns an array with exactly two items:
The current state of this state variable, initially set to the initial state you provided.
The dispatch function that lets you change it in response to interaction.
To update what’s on the screen, call dispatch with an object representing what the user did, called an action:
React will pass the current state and the action to your reducer function. Your reducer will calculate and return the next state. React will store that next state, render your component with it, and update the UI.
useReducer is very similar to useState, but it lets you move the state update logic from event handlers into a single function outside of your component. Read more about choosing between useState and useReducer.
A reducer function is declared like this:
Then you need to fill in the code that will calculate and return the next state. By convention, it is common to write it as a switch statement. For each case in the switch, calculate and return some next state.
Actions can have any shape. By convention, it’s common to pass objects with a type property identifying the action. It should include the minimal necessary information that the reducer needs to compute the next state.
The action type names are local to your component. Each action describes a single interaction, even if that leads to multiple changes in data. The shape of the state is arbitrary, but usually it’ll be an object or an array.
Read extracting state logic into a reducer to learn more.
State is read-only. Don’t modify any objects or arrays in state:
Instead, always return new objects from your reducer:
Read updating objects in state and updating arrays in state to learn more.
In this example, the reducer manages a state object with two fields: name and age.
React saves the initial state once and ignores it on the next renders.
Although the result of createInitialState(username) is only used for the initial render, you’re still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it’s creating large arrays or performing expensive calculations.
To solve this, you may pass it as an initializer function to useReducer as the third argument instead:
Notice that you’re passing createInitialState, which is the function itself, and not createInitialState(), which is the result of calling it. This way, the initial state does not get re-created after initialization.
In the above example, createInitialState takes a username argument. If your initializer doesn’t need any information to compute the initial state, you may pass null as the second argument to useReducer.
This example passes the initializer function, so the createInitialState function only runs during initialization. It does not run when component re-renders, such as when you type into the input.
Calling the dispatch function does not change state in the running code:
This is because states behaves like a snapshot. Updating state requests another render with the new state value, but does not affect the state JavaScript variable in your already-running event handler.
If you need to guess the next state value, you can calculate it manually by calling the reducer yourself:
React will ignore your update if the next state is equal to the previous state, as determined by an Object.is comparison. This usually happens when you change an object or an array in state directly:
You mutated an existing state object and returned it, so React ignored the update. To fix this, you need to ensure that you’re always updating objects in state and updating arrays in state instead of mutating them:
Make sure that every case branch copies all of the existing fields when returning the new state:
Without ...state above, the returned next state would only contain the age field and nothing else.
If your state unexpectedly becomes undefined, you’re likely forgetting to return state in one of the cases, or your action type doesn’t match any of the case statements. To find why, throw an error outside the switch:
You can also use a static type checker like TypeScript to catch such mistakes.
You might get an error that says: Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop. Typically, this means that you’re unconditionally dispatching an action during render, so your component enters a loop: render, dispatch (which causes a render), render, dispatch (which causes a render), and so on. Very often, this is caused by a mistake in specifying an event handler:
If you can’t find the cause of this error, click on the arrow next to the error in the console and look through the JavaScript stack to find the specific dispatch function call responsible for the error.
In Strict Mode, React will call your reducer and initializer functions twice. This shouldn’t break your code.
This development-only behavior helps you keep components pure. React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component, initializer, and reducer functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice the mistakes.
For example, this impure reducer function mutates an array in state:
Because React calls your reducer function twice, you’ll see the todo was added twice, so you’ll know that there is a mistake. In this example, you can fix the mistake by replacing the array instead of mutating it:
Now that this reducer function is pure, calling it an extra time doesn’t make a difference in behavior. This is why React calling it twice helps you find mistakes. Only component, initializer, and reducer functions need to be pure. Event handlers don’t need to be pure, so React will never call your event handlers twice.

I can’t get a ref to a custom component
I can’t get a ref to a custom component
Call useRef at the top level of your component to declare a ref.
See more examples below.
initialValue: The value you want the ref object’s current property to be initially. It can be a value of any type. This argument is ignored after the initial render.
useRef returns an object with a single property:
current: Initially, it’s set to the initialValue you have passed. You can later set it to something else. If you pass the ref object to React as a ref attribute to a JSX node, React will set its current property.
On the next renders, useRef will return the same object.
You can mutate the ref.current property. Unlike state, it is mutable. However, if it holds an object that is used for rendering (for example, a piece of your state), then you shouldn’t mutate that object.
When you change the ref.current property, React does not re-render your component. React is not aware of when you change it because a ref is a plain JavaScript object.
Do not write or read ref.current during rendering, except for initialization. This makes your component’s behavior unpredictable.
In Strict Mode, React will call your component function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. Each ref object will be created twice, but one of the versions will be discarded. If your component function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior.
Call useRef at the top level of your component to declare one or more refs.
useRef returns a ref object with a single current property initially set to the initial value you provided.
On the next renders, useRef will return the same object. You can change its current property to store information and read it later. This might remind you of state, but there is an important difference.
Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render. This means refs are perfect for storing information that doesn’t affect the visual output of your component. For example, if you need to store an interval ID and retrieve it later, you can put it in a ref. To update the value inside the ref, you need to manually change its current property:
Later, you can read that interval ID from the ref so that you can call clear that interval:
By using a ref, you ensure that:
You can store information between re-renders (unlike regular variables, which reset on every render).
Changing it does not trigger a re-render (unlike state variables, which trigger a re-render).
The information is local to each copy of your component (unlike the variables outside, which are shared).
Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render, so refs are not appropriate for storing information you want to display on the screen. Use state for that instead. Read more about choosing between useRef and useState.
This component uses a ref to keep track of how many times the button was clicked. Note that it’s okay to use a ref instead of state here because the click count is only read and written in an event handler.
If you show {ref.current} in the JSX, the number won’t update on click. This is because setting ref.current does not trigger a re-render. Information that’s used for rendering should be state instead.
Do not write or read ref.current during rendering.
React expects that the body of your component behaves like a pure function:
If the inputs (props, state, and context) are the same, it should return exactly the same JSX.
Calling it in a different order or with different arguments should not affect the results of other calls.
Reading or writing a ref during rendering breaks these expectations.
You can read or write refs from event handlers or effects instead.
If you have to read or write something during rendering, use state instead.
When you break these rules, your component might still work, but most of the newer features we’re adding to React will rely on these expectations. Read more about keeping your components pure.
It’s particularly common to use a ref to manipulate the DOM. React has built-in support for this.
First, declare a ref object with an initial value of null:
Then pass your ref object as the ref attribute to the JSX of the DOM node you want to manipulate:
After React creates the DOM node and puts it on the screen, React will set the current property of your ref object to that DOM node. Now you can access the <input>’s DOM node and call methods like focus():
React will set the current property back to null when the node is removed from the screen.
Read more about manipulating the DOM with refs.
In this example, clicking the button will focus the input:
React saves the initial ref value once and ignores it on the next renders.
Although the result of new VideoPlayer() is only used for the initial render, you’re still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it’s creating expensive objects.
To solve it, you may initialize the ref like this instead:
Normally, writing or reading ref.current during render is not allowed. However, it’s fine in this case because the result is always the same, and the condition only executes during initialization so it’s fully predictable.


If you try to pass a ref to your own component like this:
You might get an error in the console:
By default, your own components don’t expose refs to the DOM nodes inside them.
To fix this, find the component that you want to get a ref to:
And then wrap it in forwardRef like this:
Then the parent component can get a ref to it.

Call useState at the top level of your component to declare a state variable.
The convention is to name state variables like [something, setSomething] using array destructuring.
See more examples below.
initialState: The value you want the state to be initially. It can be a value of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions. This argument is ignored after the initial render.
If you pass a function as initialState, it will be treated as an initializer function. It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value of any type. React will call your initializer function when initializing the component, and store its return value as the initial state. See an example below.
If you pass a function as initialState, it will be treated as an initializer function. It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value of any type. React will call your initializer function when initializing the component, and store its return value as the initial state. See an example below.
useState returns an array with exactly two values:
The current state. During the first render, it will match the initialState you have passed.
The set function that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.
useState is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.
In Strict Mode, React will call your initializer function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your initializer function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.
The set function returned by useState lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render. You can pass the next state directly, or a function that calculates it from the previous state:
nextState: The value that you want the state to be. It can be a value of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions.
If you pass a function as nextState, it will be treated as an updater function. It must be pure, should take the pending state as its only argument, and should return the next state. React will put your updater function in a queue and re-render your component. During the next render, React will calculate the next state by applying all of the queued updaters to the previous state. See an example below.

See an example below.
set functions do not have a return value.
The set function only updates the state variable for the next render. If you read the state variable after calling the set function, you will still get the old value that was on the screen before your call.
The set function only updates the state variable for the next render. If you read the state variable after calling the set function, you will still get the old value that was on the screen before your call.
If the new value you provide is identical to the current state, as determined by an Object.is comparison, React will skip re-rendering the component and its children. This is an optimization. Although in some cases React may still need to call your component before skipping the children, it shouldn’t affect your code.

Although in some cases React may still need to call your component before skipping the children, it shouldn’t affect your code.
React batches state updates. It updates the screen after all the event handlers have run and have called their set functions. This prevents multiple re-renders during a single event. In the rare case that you need to force React to update the screen earlier, for example to access the DOM, you can use flushSync.

The set function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.

Calling the set function during rendering is only allowed from within the currently rendering component. React will discard its output and immediately attempt to render it again with the new state. This pattern is rarely needed, but you can use it to store information from the previous renders. See an example below.

Call useState at the top level of your component to declare one or more state variables.
The convention is to name state variables like [something, setSomething] using array destructuring.
useState returns an array with exactly two items:
The current state of this state variable, initially set to the initial state you provided.
The set function that lets you change it to any other value in response to interaction.
To update what’s on the screen, call the set function with some next state:
React will store the next state, render your component again with the new values, and update the UI.
Calling the set function does not change the current state in the already executing code:
It only affects what useState will return starting from the next render.
In this example, the count state variable holds a number. Clicking the button increments it.
Suppose the age is 42. This handler calls setAge(age + 1) three times:
However, after one click, age will only be 43 rather than 45! This is because calling the set function does not update the age state variable in the already running code. So each setAge(age + 1) call becomes setAge(43).
To solve this problem, you may pass an updater function to setAge instead of the next state:
Here, a => a + 1 is your updater function. It takes the pending state and calculates the next state from it.
React puts your updater functions in a queue. Then, during the next render, it will call them in the same order:
a => a + 1 will receive 42 as the pending state and return 43 as the next state.
a => a + 1 will receive 43 as the pending state and return 44 as the next state.
a => a + 1 will receive 44 as the pending state and return 45 as the next state.
There are no other queued updates, so React will store 45 as the current state in the end.
By convention, it’s common to name the pending state argument for the first letter of the state variable name, like a for age. However, you may also call it like prevAge or something else that you find clearer.
React may call your updaters twice in development to verify that they are pure.




This example passes the updater function, so the “+3” button works.
You can put objects and arrays into state. In React, state is considered read-only, so you should replace it rather than mutate your existing objects. For example, if you have a form object in state, don’t mutate it:
Instead, replace the whole object by creating a new one:
Read updating objects in state and updating arrays in state to learn more.
In this example, the form state variable holds an object. Each input has a change handler that calls setForm with the next state of the entire form. The { ...form } spread syntax ensures that the state object is replaced rather than mutated.
React saves the initial state once and ignores it on the next renders.
Although the result of createInitialTodos() is only used for the initial render, you’re still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it’s creating large arrays or performing expensive calculations.
To solve this, you may pass it as an initializer function to useState instead:
Notice that you’re passing createInitialTodos, which is the function itself, and not createInitialTodos(), which is the result of calling it. If you pass a function to useState, React will only call it during initialization.
React may call your initializers twice in development to verify that they are pure.
This example passes the initializer function, so the createInitialTodos function only runs during initialization. It does not run when component re-renders, such as when you type into the input.
You’ll often encounter the key attribute when rendering lists. However, it also serves another purpose.
You can reset a component’s state by passing a different key to a component. In this example, the Reset button changes the version state variable, which we pass as a key to the Form. When the key changes, React re-creates the Form component (and all of its children) from scratch, so its state gets reset.
Read preserving and resetting state to learn more.
Usually, you will update state in event handlers. However, in rare cases you might want to adjust state in response to rendering — for example, you might want to change a state variable when a prop changes.
In most cases, you don’t need this:
If the value you need can be computed entirely from the current props or other state, remove that redundant state altogether. If you’re worried about recomputing too often, the useMemo Hook can help.
If you want to reset the entire component tree’s state, pass a different key to your component.
If you can, update all the relevant state in the event handlers.
In the rare case that none of these apply, there is a pattern you can use to update state based on the values that have been rendered so far, by calling a set function while your component is rendering.
Here’s an example. This CountLabel component displays the count prop passed to it:
Say you want to show whether the counter has increased or decreased since the last change. The count prop doesn’t tell you this — you need to keep track of its previous value. Add the prevCount state variable to track it. Add another state variable called trend to hold whether the count has increased or decreased. Compare prevCount with count, and if they’re not equal, update both prevCount and trend. Now you can show both the current count prop and how it has changed since the last render.
Note that if you call a set function while rendering, it must be inside a condition like prevCount !== count, and there must be a call like setPrevCount(count) inside of the condition. Otherwise, your component would re-render in a loop until it crashes. Also, you can only update the state of the currently rendering component like this. Calling the set function of another component during rendering is an error. Finally, your set call should still update state without mutation — this doesn’t mean you can break other rules of pure functions.
This pattern can be hard to understand and is usually best avoided. However, it’s better than updating state in an effect. When you call the set function during render, React will re-render that component immediately after your component exits with a return statement, and before rendering the children. This way, children don’t need to render twice. The rest of your component function will still execute (and the result will be thrown away). If your condition is below all the Hook calls, you may add an early return; to restart rendering earlier.
Calling the set function does not change state in the running code:
This is because states behaves like a snapshot. Updating state requests another render with the new state value, but does not affect the count JavaScript variable in your already-running event handler.
If you need to use the next state, you can save it in a variable before passing it to the set function:
React will ignore your update if the next state is equal to the previous state, as determined by an Object.is comparison. This usually happens when you change an object or an array in state directly:
You mutated an existing obj object and passed it back to setObj, so React ignored the update. To fix this, you need to ensure that you’re always replacing objects and arrays in state instead of mutating them:
You might get an error that says: Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop. Typically, this means that you’re unconditionally setting state during render, so your component enters a loop: render, set state (which causes a render), render, set state (which causes a render), and so on. Very often, this is caused by a mistake in specifying an event handler:
If you can’t find the cause of this error, click on the arrow next to the error in the console and look through the JavaScript stack to find the specific set function call responsible for the error.
In Strict Mode, React will call some of your functions twice instead of once:
This is expected and shouldn’t break your code.
This development-only behavior helps you keep components pure. React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component, initializer, and updater functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice the mistakes.
For example, this impure updater function mutates an array in state:
Because React calls your updater function twice, you’ll see the todo was added twice, so you’ll know that there is a mistake. In this example, you can fix the mistake by replacing the array instead of mutating it:
Now that this updater function is pure, calling it an extra time doesn’t make a difference in behavior. This is why React calling it twice helps you find mistakes. Only component, initializer, and updater functions need to be pure. Event handlers don’t need to be pure, so React will never call your event handlers twice.
Read keeping components pure to learn more.
You can’t put a function into state like this:
Because you’re passing a function, React assumes that someFunction is an initializer function, and that someOtherFunction is an updater function, so it tries to call them and store the result. To actually store a function, you have to put () => before them in both cases. Then React will store the functions you pass.

Call useSyncExternalStore at the top level of your component to read a value from an external data store.
It returns the snapshot of the data in the store. You need to pass two functions as arguments:
The subscribe function should subscribe to the store and return a function that unsubscribes.
The getSnapshot function should read a snapshot of the data from the store.
See more examples below.
subscribe: A function that takes a single callback argument and subscribes it to the store. When the store changes, it should invoke the provided callback, which will cause React to re-call getSnapshot and (if needed) re-render the component. The subscribe function should return a function that cleans up the subscription.

The subscribe function should return a function that cleans up the subscription.
getSnapshot: A function that returns a snapshot of the data in the store that’s needed by the component. While the store has not changed, repeated calls to getSnapshot must return the same value. If the store changes and the returned value is different (as compared by Object.is), React re-renders the component.
getSnapshot: A function that returns a snapshot of the data in the store that’s needed by the component. While the store has not changed, repeated calls to getSnapshot must return the same value. If the store changes and the returned value is different (as compared by Object.is), React re-renders the component.
optional getServerSnapshot: A function that returns the initial snapshot of the data in the store. It will be used only during server rendering and during hydration of server-rendered content on the client. The server snapshot must be the same between the client and the server, and is usually serialized and passed from the server to the client. If you omit this argument, rendering the component on the server will throw an error.

If you omit this argument, rendering the component on the server will throw an error.
The current snapshot of the store which you can use in your rendering logic.
The store snapshot returned by getSnapshot must be immutable. If the underlying store has mutable data, return a new immutable snapshot if the data has changed. Otherwise, return a cached last snapshot.
The store snapshot returned by getSnapshot must be immutable. If the underlying store has mutable data, return a new immutable snapshot if the data has changed. Otherwise, return a cached last snapshot.
If a different subscribe function is passed during a re-render, React will re-subscribe to the store using the newly passed subscribe function. You can prevent this by declaring subscribe outside the component.
If a different subscribe function is passed during a re-render, React will re-subscribe to the store using the newly passed subscribe function. You can prevent this by declaring subscribe outside the component.
If the store is mutated during a non-blocking Transition update, React will fall back to performing that update as blocking. Specifically, for every Transition update, React will call getSnapshot a second time just before applying changes to the DOM. If it returns a different value than when it was called originally, React will restart the update from scratch, this time applying it as a blocking update, to ensure that every component on screen is reflecting the same version of the store.

It’s not recommended to suspend a render based on a store value returned by useSyncExternalStore. The reason is that mutations to the external store cannot be marked as non-blocking Transition updates, so they will trigger the nearest Suspense fallback, replacing already-rendered content on screen with a loading spinner, which typically makes a poor UX.
For example, the following are discouraged:
const LazyProductDetailPage = lazy(() => import('./ProductDetailPage.js'));

function ShoppingApp() {
  const selectedProductId = useSyncExternalStore(...);

  // ❌ Calling `use` with a Promise dependent on `selectedProductId`
  const data = use(fetchItem(selectedProductId))

  // ❌ Conditionally rendering a lazy component based on `selectedProductId`
  return selectedProductId != null ? <LazyProductDetailPage /> : <FeaturedProducts />;
}

For example, the following are discouraged:
Most of your React components will only read data from their props, state, and context. However, sometimes a component needs to read some data from some store outside of React that changes over time. This includes:
Third-party state management libraries that hold state outside of React.
Browser APIs that expose a mutable value and events to subscribe to its changes.
Call useSyncExternalStore at the top level of your component to read a value from an external data store.
It returns the snapshot of the data in the store. You need to pass two functions as arguments:
The subscribe function should subscribe to the store and return a function that unsubscribes.
The getSnapshot function should read a snapshot of the data from the store.
React will use these functions to keep your component subscribed to the store and re-render it on changes.
For example, in the sandbox below, todosStore is implemented as an external store that stores data outside of React. The TodosApp component connects to that external store with the useSyncExternalStore Hook.
When possible, we recommend using built-in React state with useState and useReducer instead. The useSyncExternalStore API is mostly useful if you need to integrate with existing non-React code.
Another reason to add useSyncExternalStore is when you want to subscribe to some value exposed by the browser that changes over time. For example, suppose that you want your component to display whether the network connection is active. The browser exposes this information via a property called navigator.onLine.
This value can change without React’s knowledge, so you should read it with useSyncExternalStore.
To implement the getSnapshot function, read the current value from the browser API:
Next, you need to implement the subscribe function. For example, when navigator.onLine changes, the browser fires the online and offline events on the window object. You need to subscribe the callback argument to the corresponding events, and then return a function that cleans up the subscriptions:
Now React knows how to read the value from the external navigator.onLine API and how to subscribe to its changes. Disconnect your device from the network and notice that the component re-renders in response:
Usually you won’t write useSyncExternalStore directly in your components. Instead, you’ll typically call it from your own custom Hook. This lets you use the same external store from different components.
For example, this custom useOnlineStatus Hook tracks whether the network is online:
Now different components can call useOnlineStatus without repeating the underlying implementation:
If your React app uses server rendering, your React components will also run outside the browser environment to generate the initial HTML. This creates a few challenges when connecting to an external store:
If you’re connecting to a browser-only API, it won’t work because it does not exist on the server.
If you’re connecting to a third-party data store, you’ll need its data to match between the server and client.
To solve these issues, pass a getServerSnapshot function as the third argument to useSyncExternalStore:
The getServerSnapshot function is similar to getSnapshot, but it runs only in two situations:
It runs on the server when generating the HTML.
It runs on the client during hydration, i.e. when React takes the server HTML and makes it interactive.
This lets you provide the initial snapshot value which will be used before the app becomes interactive. If there is no meaningful initial value for the server rendering, omit this argument to force rendering on the client.
Make sure that getServerSnapshot returns the same exact data on the initial client render as it returned on the server. For example, if getServerSnapshot returned some prepopulated store content on the server, you need to transfer this content to the client. One way to do this is to emit a <script> tag during server rendering that sets a global like window.MY_STORE_DATA, and read from that global on the client in getServerSnapshot. Your external store should provide instructions on how to do that.
This error means your getSnapshot function returns a new object every time it’s called, for example:
React will re-render the component if getSnapshot return value is different from the last time. This is why, if you always return a different value, you will enter an infinite loop and get this error.
Your getSnapshot object should only return a different object if something has actually changed. If your store contains immutable data, you can return that data directly:
If your store data is mutable, your getSnapshot function should return an immutable snapshot of it. This means it does need to create new objects, but it shouldn’t do this for every single call. Instead, it should store the last calculated snapshot, and return the same snapshot as the last time if the data in the store has not changed. How you determine whether mutable data has changed depends on your mutable store.
This subscribe function is defined inside a component so it is different on every re-render:
React will resubscribe to your store if you pass a different subscribe function between re-renders. If this causes performance issues and you’d like to avoid resubscribing, move the subscribe function outside:
Alternatively, wrap subscribe into useCallback to only resubscribe when some argument changes:

```
const snapshot = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, getServerSnapshot?)
```


```
import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';
import { todosStore } from './todoStore.js';

function TodosApp() {
  const todos = useSyncExternalStore(todosStore.subscribe, todosStore.getSnapshot);

function ShoppingApp() {
  const selectedProductId = useSyncExternalStore(...);

  // ❌ Calling `use` with a Promise dependent on `selectedProductId`
  const data = use(fetchItem(selectedProductId))

  // ❌ Conditionally rendering a lazy component based on `selectedProductId`
  return selectedProductId != null ? <LazyProductDetailPage /> : <FeaturedProducts />;
}
```


```
import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';
import { todosStore } from './todoStore.js';

function TodosApp() {
  const todos = useSyncExternalStore(todosStore.subscribe, todosStore.getSnapshot);
  // ...

function ChatIndicator() {
  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);
  // ...
}
```


```
function getSnapshot() {
  return navigator.onLine;
}
```


```
function subscribe(callback) {
  window.addEventListener('online', callback);
  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);
    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);
  };
}
```


```
import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';

export function useOnlineStatus() {
  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);
  return isOnline;
}

function getSnapshot() {
  // ...

function subscribe(callback) {

  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, getServerSnapshot);
  return isOnline;
}

function getSnapshot() {
  return navigator.onLine;
}

function getServerSnapshot() {
  return true; // Always show ""Online"" for server-generated HTML
}

function subscribe(callback) {
  // ...
}
```


```
function getSnapshot() {
  // 🔴 Do not return always different objects from getSnapshot
  return {
    todos: myStore.todos
  };
}
```


```
function getSnapshot() {
  // ✅ You can return immutable data
  return myStore.todos;
}

  // 🚩 Always a different function, so React will resubscribe on every re-render
  function subscribe() {
    // ...
  }

  // ...

```


```
function ChatIndicator() {
  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);
  // ...
}

// ✅ Always the same function, so React won't need to resubscribe
function subscribe() {
  // ...
}
```


```
function ChatIndicator({ userId }) {
  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);
  
  // ✅ Same function as long as userId doesn't change
  const subscribe = useCallback(() => {
    // ...
  }, [userId]);

Call useTransition at the top level of your component to mark some state updates as Transitions.
See more examples below.
useTransition does not take any parameters.
useTransition returns an array with exactly two items:
The isPending flag that tells you whether there is a pending Transition.
The startTransition function that lets you mark a state update as a Transition.
The startTransition function returned by useTransition lets you mark a state update as a Transition.
scope: A function that updates some state by calling one or more set functions. React immediately calls scope with no parameters and marks all state updates scheduled synchronously during the scope function call as Transitions. They will be non-blocking and will not display unwanted loading indicators.
startTransition does not return anything.
useTransition is a Hook, so it can only be called inside components or custom Hooks. If you need to start a Transition somewhere else (for example, from a data library), call the standalone startTransition instead.

You can wrap an update into a Transition only if you have access to the set function of that state. If you want to start a Transition in response to some prop or a custom Hook value, try useDeferredValue instead.

The function you pass to startTransition must be synchronous. React immediately executes this function, marking all state updates that happen while it executes as Transitions. If you try to perform more state updates later (for example, in a timeout), they won’t be marked as Transitions.

The startTransition function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.

A state update marked as a Transition will be interrupted by other state updates. For example, if you update a chart component inside a Transition, but then start typing into an input while the chart is in the middle of a re-render, React will restart the rendering work on the chart component after handling the input update.

Call useTransition at the top level of your component to mark state updates as non-blocking Transitions.
useTransition returns an array with exactly two items:
The isPending flag that tells you whether there is a pending Transition.
The startTransition function that lets you mark a state update as a Transition.
You can then mark a state update as a Transition like this:
Transitions let you keep the user interface updates responsive even on slow devices.
With a Transition, your UI stays responsive in the middle of a re-render. For example, if the user clicks a tab but then change their mind and click another tab, they can do that without waiting for the first re-render to finish.
In this example, the “Posts” tab is artificially slowed down so that it takes at least a second to render.
Click “Posts” and then immediately click “Contact”. Notice that this interrupts the slow render of “Posts”. The “Contact” tab shows immediately. Because this state update is marked as a Transition, a slow re-render did not freeze the user interface.
You can update a parent component’s state from the useTransition call, too. For example, this TabButton component wraps its onClick logic in a Transition:
Because the parent component updates its state inside the onClick event handler, that state update gets marked as a Transition. This is why, like in the earlier example, you can click on “Posts” and then immediately click “Contact”. Updating the selected tab is marked as a Transition, so it does not block user interactions.
You can use the isPending boolean value returned by useTransition to indicate to the user that a Transition is in progress. For example, the tab button can have a special “pending” visual state:
Notice how clicking “Posts” now feels more responsive because the tab button itself updates right away:
In this example, the PostsTab component fetches some data using a Suspense-enabled data source. When you click the “Posts” tab, the PostsTab component suspends, causing the closest loading fallback to appear:
Hiding the entire tab container to show a loading indicator leads to a jarring user experience. If you add useTransition to TabButton, you can instead indicate display the pending state in the tab button instead.
Notice that clicking “Posts” no longer replaces the entire tab container with a spinner:
Read more about using Transitions with Suspense.
Transitions will only “wait” long enough to avoid hiding already revealed content (like the tab container). If the Posts tab had a nested <Suspense> boundary, the Transition would not “wait” for it.
If you’re building a React framework or a router, we recommend marking page navigations as Transitions.
This is recommended for two reasons:
Transitions are interruptible, which lets the user click away without waiting for the re-render to complete.
Transitions prevent unwanted loading indicators, which lets the user avoid jarring jumps on navigation.
Here is a tiny simplified router example using Transitions for navigations.
Suspense-enabled routers are expected to wrap the navigation updates into Transitions by default.
Error Boundary for useTransition is currently only available in React’s canary and experimental channels. Learn more about React’s release channels here.
If a function passed to startTransition throws an error, you can display an error to your user with an error boundary. To use an error boundary, wrap the component where you are calling the useTransition in an error boundary. Once the function passed to startTransition errors, the fallback for the error boundary will be displayed.
You can’t use a Transition for a state variable that controls an input:
This is because Transitions are non-blocking, but updating an input in response to the change event should happen synchronously. If you want to run a Transition in response to typing, you have two options:
You can declare two separate state variables: one for the input state (which always updates synchronously), and one that you will update in a Transition. This lets you control the input using the synchronous state, and pass the Transition state variable (which will “lag behind” the input) to the rest of your rendering logic.
Alternatively, you can have one state variable, and add useDeferredValue which will “lag behind” the real value. It will trigger non-blocking re-renders to “catch up” with the new value automatically.
When you wrap a state update in a Transition, make sure that it happens during the startTransition call:
The function you pass to startTransition must be synchronous.
You can’t mark an update as a Transition like this:
Instead, you could do this:
Similarly, you can’t mark an update as a Transition like this:
However, this works instead:
You can’t call useTransition outside a component because it’s a Hook. In this case, use the standalone startTransition method instead. It works the same way, but it doesn’t provide the isPending indicator.
If you run this code, it will print 1, 2, 3:
It is expected to print 1, 2, 3. The function you pass to startTransition does not get delayed. Unlike with the browser setTimeout, it does not run the callback later. React executes your function immediately, but any state updates scheduled while it is running are marked as Transitions. You can imagine that it works like this:

```
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition()
```


```
import { useTransition } from 'react';

function TabContainer() {
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

Rendering a list of Fragments
Wrap elements in <Fragment> to group them together in situations where you need a single element. Grouping elements in Fragment has no effect on the resulting DOM; it is the same as if the elements were not grouped. The empty JSX tag <></> is shorthand for <Fragment></Fragment> in most cases.
optional key: Fragments declared with the explicit <Fragment> syntax may have keys.
If you want to pass key to a Fragment, you can’t use the <>...</> syntax. You have to explicitly import Fragment from 'react' and render <Fragment key={yourKey}>...</Fragment>.
If you want to pass key to a Fragment, you can’t use the <>...</> syntax. You have to explicitly import Fragment from 'react' and render <Fragment key={yourKey}>...</Fragment>.
React does not reset state when you go from rendering <><Child /></> to [<Child />] or back, or when you go from rendering <><Child /></> to <Child /> and back. This only works a single level deep: for example, going from <><><Child /></></> to <Child /> resets the state. See the precise semantics here.

This only works a single level deep: for example, going from <><><Child /></></> to <Child /> resets the state. See the precise semantics here.
Use Fragment, or the equivalent <>...</> syntax, to group multiple elements together. You can use it to put multiple elements in any place where a single element can go. For example, a component can only return one element, but by using a Fragment you can group multiple elements together and then return them as a group:
Fragments are useful because grouping elements with a Fragment has no effect on layout or styles, unlike if you wrapped the elements in another container like a DOM element. If you inspect this example with the browser tools, you’ll see that all <h1> and <article> DOM nodes appear as siblings without wrappers around them:


Like any other element, you can assign Fragment elements to variables, pass them as props, and so on:
You can use Fragment to group text together with components:
Here’s a situation where you need to write Fragment explicitly instead of using the <></> syntax. When you render multiple elements in a loop, you need to assign a key to each element. If the elements within the loop are Fragments, you need to use the normal JSX element syntax in order to provide the key attribute:
You can inspect the DOM to verify that there are no wrapper elements around the Fragment children:

```
<>
  <OneChild />
  <AnotherChild />
</>

```
function Post() {
  return (
    <>
      <PostTitle />

Usage

Measuring rendering performance programmatically
Measuring different parts of the application
Wrap a component tree in a <Profiler> to measure its rendering performance.
id: A string identifying the part of the UI you are measuring.
onRender: An onRender callback that React calls every time components within the profiled tree update. It receives information about what was rendered and how much time it took.
Profiling adds some additional overhead, so it is disabled in the production build by default. To opt into production profiling, you need to enable a special production build with profiling enabled.
React will call your onRender callback with information about what was rendered.
id: The string id prop of the <Profiler> tree that has just committed. This lets you identify which part of the tree was committed if you are using multiple profilers.
phase: ""mount"", ""update"" or ""nested-update"". This lets you know whether the tree has just been mounted for the first time or re-rendered due to a change in props, state, or Hooks.
actualDuration: The number of milliseconds spent rendering the <Profiler> and its descendants for the current update. This indicates how well the subtree makes use of memoization (e.g. memo and useMemo). Ideally this value should decrease significantly after the initial mount as many of the descendants will only need to re-render if their specific props change.
baseDuration: The number of milliseconds estimating how much time it would take to re-render the entire <Profiler> subtree without any optimizations. It is calculated by summing up the most recent render durations of each component in the tree. This value estimates a worst-case cost of rendering (e.g. the initial mount or a tree with no memoization). Compare actualDuration against it to see if memoization is working.
startTime: A numeric timestamp for when React began rendering the current update.
commitTime: A numeric timestamp for when React committed the current update. This value is shared between all profilers in a commit, enabling them to be grouped if desirable.
Wrap the <Profiler> component around a React tree to measure its rendering performance.
It requires two props: an id (string) and an onRender callback (function) which React calls any time a component within the tree “commits” an update.
Profiling adds some additional overhead, so it is disabled in the production build by default. To opt into production profiling, you need to enable a special production build with profiling enabled.
<Profiler> lets you gather measurements programmatically. If you’re looking for an interactive profiler, try the Profiler tab in React Developer Tools. It exposes similar functionality as a browser extension.
You can use multiple <Profiler> components to measure different parts of your application:
You can also nest <Profiler> components:
Although <Profiler> is a lightweight component, it should be used only when necessary. Each use adds some CPU and memory overhead to an application.

```
<Profiler id=""App"" onRender={onRender}>
  <App />
</Profiler>
```


```

StrictMode accepts no props.
There is no way to opt out of Strict Mode inside a tree wrapped in <StrictMode>. This gives you confidence that all components inside <StrictMode> are checked. If two teams working on a product disagree whether they find the checks valuable, they need to either reach consensus or move <StrictMode> down in the tree.
Strict Mode enables extra development-only checks for the entire component tree inside the <StrictMode> component. These checks help you find common bugs in your components early in the development process.
To enable Strict Mode for your entire app, wrap your root component with <StrictMode> when you render it:
We recommend wrapping your entire app in Strict Mode, especially for newly created apps. If you use a framework that calls createRoot for you, check its documentation for how to enable Strict Mode.
Although the Strict Mode checks only run in development, they help you find bugs that already exist in your code but can be tricky to reliably reproduce in production. Strict Mode lets you fix bugs before your users report them.
Strict Mode enables the following checks in development:
Your components will re-render an extra time to find bugs caused by impure rendering.
Your components will re-run Effects an extra time to find bugs caused by missing Effect cleanup.
Your components will be checked for usage of deprecated APIs.
All of these checks are development-only and do not impact the production build.
You can also enable Strict Mode for any part of your application:
In this example, Strict Mode checks will not run against the Header and Footer components. However, they will run on Sidebar and Content, as well as all of the components inside them, no matter how deep.
React assumes that every component you write is a pure function. This means that React components you write must always return the same JSX given the same inputs (props, state, and context).
Components breaking this rule behave unpredictably and cause bugs. To help you find accidentally impure code, Strict Mode calls some of your functions (only the ones that should be pure) twice in development. This includes:
Your component function body (only top-level logic, so this doesn’t include code inside event handlers)
Functions that you pass to useState, set functions, useMemo, or useReducer
Some class component methods like constructor, render, shouldComponentUpdate (see the whole list)
If a function is pure, running it twice does not change its behavior because a pure function produces the same result every time. However, if a function is impure (for example, it mutates the data it receives), running it twice tends to be noticeable (that’s what makes it impure!) This helps you spot and fix the bug early.
Here is an example to illustrate how double rendering in Strict Mode helps you find bugs early.
This StoryTray component takes an array of stories and adds one last “Create Story” item at the end:
There is a mistake in the code above. However, it is easy to miss because the initial output appears correct.
This mistake will become more noticeable if the StoryTray component re-renders multiple times. For example, let’s make the StoryTray re-render with a different background color whenever you hover over it:
Notice how every time you hover over the StoryTray component, “Create Story” gets added to the list again. The intention of the code was to add it once at the end. But StoryTray directly modifies the stories array from the props. Every time StoryTray renders, it adds “Create Story” again at the end of the same array. In other words, StoryTray is not a pure function—running it multiple times produces different results.
To fix this problem, you can make a copy of the array, and modify that copy instead of the original one:
This would make the StoryTray function pure. Each time it is called, it would only modify a new copy of the array, and would not affect any external objects or variables. This solves the bug, but you had to make the component re-render more often before it became obvious that something is wrong with its behavior.
In the original example, the bug wasn’t obvious. Now let’s wrap the original (buggy) code in <StrictMode>:
Strict Mode always calls your rendering function twice, so you can see the mistake right away (“Create Story” appears twice). This lets you notice such mistakes early in the process. When you fix your component to render in Strict Mode, you also fix many possible future production bugs like the hover functionality from before:
Without Strict Mode, it was easy to miss the bug until you added more re-renders. Strict Mode made the same bug appear right away. Strict Mode helps you find bugs before you push them to your team and to your users.
Read more about keeping components pure.
If you have React DevTools installed, any console.log calls during the second render call will appear slightly dimmed. React DevTools also offers a setting (off by default) to suppress them completely.
Strict Mode can also help find bugs in Effects.
Every Effect has some setup code and may have some cleanup code. Normally, React calls setup when the component mounts (is added to the screen) and calls cleanup when the component unmounts (is removed from the screen). React then calls cleanup and setup again if its dependencies changed since the last render.
When Strict Mode is on, React will also run one extra setup+cleanup cycle in development for every Effect. This may feel surprising, but it helps reveal subtle bugs that are hard to catch manually.
Here is an example to illustrate how re-running Effects in Strict Mode helps you find bugs early.
Consider this example that connects a component to a chat:
There is an issue with this code, but it might not be immediately clear.
To make the issue more obvious, let’s implement a feature. In the example below, roomId is not hardcoded. Instead, the user can select the roomId that they want to connect to from a dropdown. Click “Open chat” and then select different chat rooms one by one. Keep track of the number of active connections in the console:
You’ll notice that the number of open connections always keeps growing. In a real app, this would cause performance and network problems. The issue is that your Effect is missing a cleanup function:
Now that your Effect “cleans up” after itself and destroys the outdated connections, the leak is solved. However, notice that the problem did not become visible until you’ve added more features (the select box).
In the original example, the bug wasn’t obvious. Now let’s wrap the original (buggy) code in <StrictMode>:
With Strict Mode, you immediately see that there is a problem (the number of active connections jumps to 2). Strict Mode runs an extra setup+cleanup cycle for every Effect. This Effect has no cleanup logic, so it creates an extra connection but doesn’t destroy it. This is a hint that you’re missing a cleanup function.
Strict Mode lets you notice such mistakes early in the process. When you fix your Effect by adding a cleanup function in Strict Mode, you also fix many possible future production bugs like the select box from before:
Notice how the active connection count in the console doesn’t keep growing anymore.
Without Strict Mode, it was easy to miss that your Effect needed cleanup. By running setup → cleanup → setup instead of setup for your Effect in development, Strict Mode made the missing cleanup logic more noticeable.
Read more about implementing Effect cleanup.
React warns if some component anywhere inside a <StrictMode> tree uses one of these deprecated APIs:
findDOMNode. See alternatives.
UNSAFE_ class lifecycle methods like UNSAFE_componentWillMount. See alternatives.
Legacy context (childContextTypes, contextTypes, and getChildContext). See alternatives.
Legacy string refs (this.refs). See alternatives.
These APIs are primarily used in older class components so they rarely appear in modern apps.

```
<StrictMode>
  <App />
</StrictMode>

```
import { StrictMode } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>
);

          <Content />
        </main>
      </StrictMode>
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
}
```


```
export default function StoryTray({ stories }) {
  const items = stories.slice(); // Clone the array
  // ✅ Good: Pushing into a new array
  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });
```


```
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]);

How do I prevent the UI from being replaced by a fallback during an update?
How do I prevent the UI from being replaced by a fallback during an update?
children: The actual UI you intend to render. If children suspends while rendering, the Suspense boundary will switch to rendering fallback.
fallback: An alternate UI to render in place of the actual UI if it has not finished loading. Any valid React node is accepted, though in practice, a fallback is a lightweight placeholder view, such as a loading spinner or skeleton. Suspense will automatically switch to fallback when children suspends, and back to children when the data is ready. If fallback suspends while rendering, it will activate the closest parent Suspense boundary.
React does not preserve any state for renders that got suspended before they were able to mount for the first time. When the component has loaded, React will retry rendering the suspended tree from scratch.
If Suspense was displaying content for the tree, but then it suspended again, the fallback will be shown again unless the update causing it was caused by startTransition or useDeferredValue.
If React needs to hide the already visible content because it suspended again, it will clean up layout Effects in the content tree. When the content is ready to be shown again, React will fire the layout Effects again. This ensures that Effects measuring the DOM layout don’t try to do this while the content is hidden.
React includes under-the-hood optimizations like Streaming Server Rendering and Selective Hydration that are integrated with Suspense. Read an architectural overview and watch a technical talk to learn more.
You can wrap any part of your application with a Suspense boundary:
React will display your loading fallback until all the code and data needed by the children has been loaded.
In the example below, the Albums component suspends while fetching the list of albums. Until it’s ready to render, React switches the closest Suspense boundary above to show the fallback—your Loading component. Then, when the data loads, React hides the Loading fallback and renders the Albums component with data.
Only Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component. They include:
Data fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js
Lazy-loading component code with lazy
Reading the value of a Promise with use
Suspense does not detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.
The exact way you would load data in the Albums component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.
Suspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.
By default, the whole tree inside Suspense is treated as a single unit. For example, even if only one of these components suspends waiting for some data, all of them together will be replaced by the loading indicator:
Then, after all of them are ready to be displayed, they will all appear together at once.
In the example below, both Biography and Albums fetch some data. However, because they are grouped under a single Suspense boundary, these components always “pop in” together at the same time.
Components that load data don’t have to be direct children of the Suspense boundary. For example, you can move Biography and Albums into a new Details component. This doesn’t change the behavior. Biography and Albums share the same closest parent Suspense boundary, so their reveal is coordinated together.
When a component suspends, the closest parent Suspense component shows the fallback. This lets you nest multiple Suspense components to create a loading sequence. Each Suspense boundary’s fallback will be filled in as the next level of content becomes available. For example, you can give the album list its own fallback:
With this change, displaying the Biography doesn’t need to “wait” for the Albums to load.
The sequence will be:
If Biography hasn’t loaded yet, BigSpinner is shown in place of the entire content area.
Once Biography finishes loading, BigSpinner is replaced by the content.
If Albums hasn’t loaded yet, AlbumsGlimmer is shown in place of Albums and its parent Panel.
Finally, once Albums finishes loading, it replaces AlbumsGlimmer.
Suspense boundaries let you coordinate which parts of your UI should always “pop in” together at the same time, and which parts should progressively reveal more content in a sequence of loading states. You can add, move, or delete Suspense boundaries in any place in the tree without affecting the rest of your app’s behavior.
Don’t put a Suspense boundary around every component. Suspense boundaries should not be more granular than the loading sequence that you want the user to experience. If you work with a designer, ask them where the loading states should be placed—it’s likely that they’ve already included them in their design wireframes.
In this example, the SearchResults component suspends while fetching the search results. Type ""a"", wait for the results, and then edit it to ""ab"". The results for ""a"" will get replaced by the loading fallback.
A common alternative UI pattern is to defer updating the list and to keep showing the previous results until the new results are ready. The useDeferredValue Hook lets you pass a deferred version of the query down:
The query will update immediately, so the input will display the new value. However, the deferredQuery will keep its previous value until the data has loaded, so SearchResults will show the stale results for a bit.
To make it more obvious to the user, you can add a visual indication when the stale result list is displayed:
Enter ""a"" in the example below, wait for the results to load, and then edit the input to ""ab"". Notice how instead of the Suspense fallback, you now see the dimmed stale result list until the new results have loaded:
Both deferred values and Transitions let you avoid showing Suspense fallback in favor of inline indicators. Transitions mark the whole update as non-urgent so they are typically used by frameworks and router libraries for navigation. Deferred values, on the other hand, are mostly useful in application code where you want to mark a part of UI as non-urgent and let it “lag behind” the rest of the UI.
When a component suspends, the closest parent Suspense boundary switches to showing the fallback. This can lead to a jarring user experience if it was already displaying some content. Try pressing this button:
When you pressed the button, the Router component rendered ArtistPage instead of IndexPage. A component inside ArtistPage suspended, so the closest Suspense boundary started showing the fallback. The closest Suspense boundary was near the root, so the whole site layout got replaced by BigSpinner.
To prevent this, you can mark the navigation state update as a Transition with startTransition:
This tells React that the state transition is not urgent, and it’s better to keep showing the previous page instead of hiding any already revealed content. Now clicking the button “waits” for the Biography to load:
A Transition doesn’t wait for all content to load. It only waits long enough to avoid hiding already revealed content. For example, the website Layout was already revealed, so it would be bad to hide it behind a loading spinner. However, the nested Suspense boundary around Albums is new, so the Transition doesn’t wait for it.
Suspense-enabled routers are expected to wrap the navigation updates into Transitions by default.
In the above example, once you click the button, there is no visual indication that a navigation is in progress. To add an indicator, you can replace startTransition with useTransition which gives you a boolean isPending value. In the example below, it’s used to change the website header styling while a Transition is happening:
During a Transition, React will avoid hiding already revealed content. However, if you navigate to a route with different parameters, you might want to tell React it is different content. You can express this with a key:
Imagine you’re navigating within a user’s profile page, and something suspends. If that update is wrapped in a Transition, it will not trigger the fallback for already visible content. That’s the expected behavior.
However, now imagine you’re navigating between two different user profiles. In that case, it makes sense to show the fallback. For example, one user’s timeline is different content from another user’s timeline. By specifying a key, you ensure that React treats different users’ profiles as different components, and resets the Suspense boundaries during navigation. Suspense-integrated routers should do this automatically.
If you use one of the streaming server rendering APIs (or a framework that relies on them), React will also use your <Suspense> boundaries to handle errors on the server. If a component throws an error on the server, React will not abort the server render. Instead, it will find the closest <Suspense> component above it and include its fallback (such as a spinner) into the generated server HTML. The user will see a spinner at first.
On the client, React will attempt to render the same component again. If it errors on the client too, React will throw the error and display the closest error boundary. However, if it does not error on the client, React will not display the error to the user since the content was eventually displayed successfully.
You can use this to opt out some components from rendering on the server. To do this, throw an error in the server environment and then wrap them in a <Suspense> boundary to replace their HTML with fallbacks:
The server HTML will include the loading indicator. It will be replaced by the Chat component on the client.
Replacing visible UI with a fallback creates a jarring user experience. This can happen when an update causes a component to suspend, and the nearest Suspense boundary is already showing content to the user.
To prevent this from happening, mark the update as non-urgent using startTransition. During a Transition, React will wait until enough data has loaded to prevent an unwanted fallback from appearing:
This will avoid hiding existing content. However, any newly rendered Suspense boundaries will still immediately display fallbacks to avoid blocking the UI and let the user see the content as it becomes available.
React will only prevent unwanted fallbacks during non-urgent updates. It will not delay a render if it’s the result of an urgent update. You must opt in with an API like startTransition or useDeferredValue.
If your router is integrated with Suspense, it should wrap its updates into startTransition automatically.

# Built-in React APIs


# Resource APIs

In addition to Hooks and Components, the react package exports a few other APIs that are useful for defining components. This page lists all the remaining modern React APIs.
createContext lets you define and provide context to the child components. Used with useContext.
forwardRef lets your component expose a DOM node as a ref to the parent. Used with useRef.
lazy lets you defer loading a component’s code until it’s rendered for the first time.
memo lets your component skip re-renders with same props. Used with useMemo and useCallback.
startTransition lets you mark a state update as non-urgent. Similar to useTransition.
act lets you wrap renders and interactions in tests to ensure updates have processed before making assertions.
Resources can be accessed by a component without having them as part of their state. For example, a component can read a message from a Promise or read styling information from a context.
To read a value from a resource, use this API:
use lets you read the value of a resource like a Promise or context.

```
function MessageComponent({ messagePromise }) {
  const message = use(messagePromise);
  const theme = use(ThemeContext);
  // ...
}

act is a test helper to apply pending React updates before making assertions.
To prepare a component for assertions, wrap the code rendering it and performing updates inside an await act() call. This makes your test run closer to how React works in the browser.
You might find using act() directly a bit too verbose. To avoid some of the boilerplate, you could use a library like React Testing Library, whose helpers are wrapped with act().

I’m getting an error: “The current testing environment is not configured to support act”(…)”
When writing UI tests, tasks like rendering, user events, or data fetching can be considered as “units” of interaction with a user interface. React provides a helper called act() that makes sure all updates related to these “units” have been processed and applied to the DOM before you make any assertions.
The name act comes from the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
We recommend using act with await and an async function. Although the sync version works in many cases, it doesn’t work in all cases and due to the way React schedules updates internally, it’s difficult to predict when you can use the sync version.
We will deprecate and remove the sync version in the future.
async actFn: An async function wrapping renders or interactions for components being tested. Any updates triggered within the actFn, are added to an internal act queue, which are then flushed together to process and apply any changes to the DOM. Since it is async, React will also run any code that crosses an async boundary, and flush any updates scheduled.
act does not return anything.
When testing a component, you can use act to make assertions about its output.
For example, let’s say we have this Counter component, the usage examples below show how to test it:
To test the render output of a component, wrap the render inside act():
Here, we create a container, append it to the document, and render the Counter component inside act(). This ensures that the component is rendered and its effects are applied before making assertions.
Using act ensures that all updates have been applied before we make assertions.
To test events, wrap the event dispatch inside act():
Here, we render the component with act, and then dispatch the event inside another act(). This ensures that all updates from the event are applied before making assertions.
Don’t forget that dispatching DOM events only works when the DOM container is added to the document. You can use a library like React Testing Library to reduce the boilerplate code.
Using act requires setting global.IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT=true in your test environment. This is to ensure that act is only used in the correct environment.
If you don’t set the global, you will see an error like this:
To fix, add this to your global setup file for React tests:
In testing frameworks like React Testing Library, IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT is already set for you.

My memoized function still runs even though I’ve called it with the same arguments
Call cache outside of any components to create a version of the function with caching.
When getMetrics is first called with data, getMetrics will call calculateMetrics(data) and store the result in cache. If getMetrics is called again with the same data, it will return the cached result instead of calling calculateMetrics(data) again.
See more examples below.
fn: The function you want to cache results for. fn can take any arguments and return any value.
cache returns a cached version of fn with the same type signature. It does not call fn in the process.
When calling cachedFn with given arguments, it first checks if a cached result exists in the cache. If a cached result exists, it returns the result. If not, it calls fn with the arguments, stores the result in the cache, and returns the result. The only time fn is called is when there is a cache miss.
The optimization of caching return values based on inputs is known as memoization. We refer to the function returned from cache as a memoized function.
React will invalidate the cache for all memoized functions for each server request.
Each call to cache creates a new function. This means that calling cache with the same function multiple times will return different memoized functions that do not share the same cache.
cachedFn will also cache errors. If fn throws an error for certain arguments, it will be cached, and the same error is re-thrown when cachedFn is called with those same arguments.
cache is for use in Server Components only.
Use cache to skip duplicate work.
If the same user object is rendered in both Profile and TeamReport, the two components can share work and only call calculateUserMetrics once for that user.
Assume Profile is rendered first. It will call getUserMetrics, and check if there is a cached result. Since it is the first time getUserMetrics is called with that user, there will be a cache miss. getUserMetrics will then call calculateUserMetrics with that user and write the result to cache.
When TeamReport renders its list of users and reaches the same user object, it will call getUserMetrics and read the result from cache.
To access the same cache, components must call the same memoized function.
In the above example, Precipitation and Temperature each call cache to create a new memoized function with their own cache look-up. If both components render for the same cityData, they will do duplicate work to call calculateWeekReport.
In addition, Temperature creates a new memoized function each time the component is rendered which doesn’t allow for any cache sharing.
To maximize cache hits and reduce work, the two components should call the same memoized function to access the same cache. Instead, define the memoized function in a dedicated module that can be import-ed across components.
Here, both components call the same memoized function exported from ./getWeekReport.js to read and write to the same cache.
To share a snapshot of data between components, call cache with a data-fetching function like fetch. When multiple components make the same data fetch, only one request is made and the data returned is cached and shared across components. All components refer to the same snapshot of data across the server render.
If AnimatedWeatherCard and MinimalWeatherCard both render for the same city, they will receive the same snapshot of data from the memoized function.
If AnimatedWeatherCard and MinimalWeatherCard supply different city arguments to getTemperature, then fetchTemperature will be called twice and each call site will receive different data.
The city acts as a cache key.
Asynchronous rendering is only supported for Server Components.
By caching a long-running data fetch, you can kick off asynchronous work prior to rendering the component.
When rendering Page, the component calls getUser but note that it doesn’t use the returned data. This early getUser call kicks off the asynchronous database query that occurs while Page is doing other computational work and rendering children.
When rendering Profile, we call getUser again. If the initial getUser call has already returned and cached the user data, when Profile asks and waits for this data, it can simply read from the cache without requiring another remote procedure call. If the  initial data request hasn’t been completed, preloading data in this pattern reduces delay in data-fetching.






React only provides cache access to the memoized function in a component. When calling getUser outside of a component, it will still evaluate the function but not read or update the cache.
This is because cache access is provided through a context which is only accessible from a component.










See prior mentioned pitfalls
Calling different memoized functions will read from different caches.
Calling a memoized function outside of a component will not use the cache.
If none of the above apply, it may be a problem with how React checks if something exists in cache.
If your arguments are not primitives (ex. objects, functions, arrays), ensure you’re passing the same object reference.
When calling a memoized function, React will look up the input arguments to see if a result is already cached. React will use shallow equality of the arguments to determine if there is a cache hit.
In this case the two MapMarkers look like they’re doing the same work and calling calculateNorm with the same value of {x: 10, y: 10, z:10}. Even though the objects contain the same values, they are not the same object reference as each component creates its own props object.
React will call Object.is on the input to verify if there is a cache hit.
One way to address this could be to pass the vector dimensions to calculateNorm. This works because the dimensions themselves are primitives.
Another solution may be to pass the vector object itself as a prop to the component. We’ll need to pass the same object to both component instances.

I can’t find a way to change the context value
I can’t find a way to change the context value
Call createContext outside of any components to create a context.
See more examples below.
defaultValue: The value that you want the context to have when there is no matching context provider in the tree above the component that reads context. If you don’t have any meaningful default value, specify null. The default value is meant as a “last resort” fallback. It is static and never changes over time.
createContext returns a context object.
The context object itself does not hold any information. It represents which context other components read or provide. Typically, you will use SomeContext.Provider in components above to specify the context value, and call useContext(SomeContext) in components below to read it. The context object has a few properties:
SomeContext.Provider lets you provide the context value to components.
SomeContext.Consumer is an alternative and rarely used way to read the context value.
Wrap your components into a context provider to specify the value of this context for all components inside:
value: The value that you want to pass to all the components reading this context inside this provider, no matter how deep. The context value can be of any type. A component calling useContext(SomeContext) inside of the provider receives the value of the innermost corresponding context provider above it.
Before useContext existed, there was an older way to read context:
Although this older way still works, but newly written code should read context with useContext() instead:
children: A function. React will call the function you pass with the current context value determined by the same algorithm as useContext() does, and render the result you return from this function. React will also re-run this function and update the UI whenever the context from the parent components changes.
Context lets components pass information deep down without explicitly passing props.
Call createContext outside any components to create one or more contexts.
createContext returns a context object. Components can read context by passing it to useContext():
By default, the values they receive will be the default values you have specified when creating the contexts. However, by itself this isn’t useful because the default values never change.
Context is useful because you can provide other, dynamic values from your components:
Now the Page component and any components inside it, no matter how deep, will “see” the passed context values. If the passed context values change, React will re-render the components reading the context as well.
Read more about reading and providing context and see examples.
Often, components in different files will need access to the same context. This is why it’s common to declare contexts in a separate file. Then you can use the export statement to make context available for other files:
Components declared in other files can then use the import statement to read or provide this context:
This works similar to importing and exporting components.
Code like this specifies the default context value:
This value never changes. React only uses this value as a fallback if it can’t find a matching provider above.
To make context change over time, add state and wrap components in a context provider.

```
const SomeContext = createContext(defaultValue)

Troubleshooting
My component is wrapped in forwardRef, but the ref to it is always null
My component is wrapped in forwardRef, but the ref to it is always null
Call forwardRef() to let your component receive a ref and forward it to a child component:
See more examples below.
render: The render function for your component. React calls this function with the props and ref that your component received from its parent. The JSX you return will be the output of your component.
forwardRef returns a React component that you can render in JSX. Unlike React components defined as plain functions, a component returned by forwardRef is also able to receive a ref prop.
In Strict Mode, React will call your render function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your render function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the logic of your component. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.
forwardRef accepts a render function as an argument. React calls this function with props and ref:
props: The props passed by the parent component.
props: The props passed by the parent component.
ref:  The ref attribute passed by the parent component. The ref can be an object or a function. If the parent component has not passed a ref, it will be null. You should either pass the ref you receive to another component, or pass it to useImperativeHandle.
ref:  The ref attribute passed by the parent component. The ref can be an object or a function. If the parent component has not passed a ref, it will be null. You should either pass the ref you receive to another component, or pass it to useImperativeHandle.
forwardRef returns a React component that you can render in JSX. Unlike React components defined as plain functions, the component returned by forwardRef is able to take a ref prop.
By default, each component’s DOM nodes are private. However, sometimes it’s useful to expose a DOM node to the parent—for example, to allow focusing it. To opt in, wrap your component definition into forwardRef():
You will receive a ref as the second argument after props. Pass it to the DOM node that you want to expose:
This lets the parent Form component access the <input> DOM node exposed by MyInput:
This Form component passes a ref to MyInput. The MyInput component forwards that ref to the <input> browser tag. As a result, the Form component can access that <input> DOM node and call focus() on it.
Keep in mind that exposing a ref to the DOM node inside your component makes it harder to change your component’s internals later. You will typically expose DOM nodes from reusable low-level components like buttons or text inputs, but you won’t do it for application-level components like an avatar or a comment.
Clicking the button will focus the input. The Form component defines a ref and passes it to the MyInput component. The MyInput component forwards that ref to the browser <input>. This lets the Form component focus the <input>.
Instead of forwarding a ref to a DOM node, you can forward it to your own component like MyInput:
If that MyInput component forwards a ref to its <input>, a ref to FormField will give you that <input>:
The Form component defines a ref and passes it to FormField. The FormField component forwards that ref to MyInput, which forwards it to a browser <input> DOM node. This is how Form accesses that DOM node.
Instead of exposing an entire DOM node, you can expose a custom object, called an imperative handle, with a more constrained set of methods. To do this, you’d need to define a separate ref to hold the DOM node:
Pass the ref you received to useImperativeHandle and specify the value you want to expose to the ref:
If some component gets a ref to MyInput, it will only receive your { focus, scrollIntoView } object instead of the DOM node. This lets you limit the information you expose about your DOM node to the minimum.
Read more about using imperative handles.
Do not overuse refs. You should only use refs for imperative behaviors that you can’t express as props: for example, scrolling to a node, focusing a node, triggering an animation, selecting text, and so on.
If you can express something as a prop, you should not use a ref. For example, instead of exposing an imperative handle like { open, close } from a Modal component, it is better to take isOpen as a prop like <Modal isOpen={isOpen} />. Effects can help you expose imperative behaviors via props.
This usually means that you forgot to actually use the ref that you received.
For example, this component doesn’t do anything with its ref:
To fix it, pass the ref down to a DOM node or another component that can accept a ref:
The ref to MyInput could also be null if some of the logic is conditional:
If showInput is false, then the ref won’t be forwarded to any node, and a ref to MyInput will remain empty. This is particularly easy to miss if the condition is hidden inside another component, like Panel in this example:

```
const SomeComponent = forwardRef(render)

Troubleshooting
My lazy component’s state gets reset unexpectedly
My lazy component’s state gets reset unexpectedly
Call lazy outside your components to declare a lazy-loaded React component:
See more examples below.
load: A function that returns a Promise or another thenable (a Promise-like object with a then method). React will not call load until the first time you attempt to render the returned component. After React first calls load, it will wait for it to resolve, and then render the resolved value’s .default as a React component. Both the returned Promise and the Promise’s resolved value will be cached, so React will not call load more than once. If the Promise rejects, React will throw the rejection reason for the nearest Error Boundary to handle.
lazy returns a React component you can render in your tree. While the code for the lazy component is still loading, attempting to render it will suspend. Use <Suspense> to display a loading indicator while it’s loading.
load receives no parameters.
You need to return a Promise or some other thenable (a Promise-like object with a then method). It needs to eventually resolve to an object whose .default property is a valid React component type, such as a function, memo, or a forwardRef component.
Usually, you import components with the static import declaration:
To defer loading this component’s code until it’s rendered for the first time, replace this import with:
This code relies on dynamic import(), which might require support from your bundler or framework. Using this pattern requires that the lazy component you’re importing was exported as the default export.
Now that your component’s code loads on demand, you also need to specify what should be displayed while it is loading. You can do this by wrapping the lazy component or any of its parents into a <Suspense> boundary:
In this example, the code for MarkdownPreview won’t be loaded until you attempt to render it. If MarkdownPreview hasn’t loaded yet, Loading will be shown in its place. Try ticking the checkbox:
This demo loads with an artificial delay. The next time you untick and tick the checkbox, Preview will be cached, so there will be no loading state. To see the loading state again, click “Reset” on the sandbox.
Learn more about managing loading states with Suspense.
Do not declare lazy components inside other components:
Instead, always declare them at the top level of your module:

```
const SomeComponent = lazy(load)
```


```
import { lazy } from 'react';

const MarkdownPreview = lazy(() => import('./MarkdownPreview.js'));
```


```
import MarkdownPreview from './MarkdownPreview.js';
```


```
import { lazy } from 'react';

const MarkdownPreview = lazy(() => import('./MarkdownPreview.js'));
```


```
<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <h2>Preview</h2>
  <MarkdownPreview />
</Suspense>
```


```
import { lazy } from 'react';

function Editor() {
  // 🔴 Bad: This will cause all state to be reset on re-renders
  const MarkdownPreview = lazy(() => import('./MarkdownPreview.js'));
  // ...
}
```


```
import { lazy } from 'react';

// ✅ Good: Declare lazy components outside of your components

Wrap a component in memo to get a memoized version of that component.

But React may still re-render it: memoization is a performance optimization, not a guarantee.
See more examples below.
Component: The component that you want to memoize. The memo does not modify this component, but returns a new, memoized component instead. Any valid React component, including functions and forwardRef components, is accepted.

optional arePropsEqual: A function that accepts two arguments: the component’s previous props, and its new props. It should return true if the old and new props are equal: that is, if the component will render the same output and behave in the same way with the new props as with the old. Otherwise it should return false. Usually, you will not specify this function. By default, React will compare each prop with Object.is.

Otherwise it should return false. Usually, you will not specify this function. By default, React will compare each prop with Object.is.
memo returns a new React component. It behaves the same as the component provided to memo except that React will not always re-render it when its parent is being re-rendered unless its props have changed.
React normally re-renders a component whenever its parent re-renders. With memo, you can create a component that React will not re-render when its parent re-renders so long as its new props are the same as the old props. Such a component is said to be memoized.
To memoize a component, wrap it in memo and use the value that it returns in place of your original component:
A React component should always have pure rendering logic. This means that it must return the same output if its props, state, and context haven’t changed. By using memo, you are telling React that your component complies with this requirement, so React doesn’t need to re-render as long as its props haven’t changed. Even with memo, your component will re-render if its own state changes or if a context that it’s using changes.
In this example, notice that the Greeting component re-renders whenever name is changed (because that’s one of its props), but not when address is changed (because it’s not passed to Greeting as a prop):
You should only rely on memo as a performance optimization. If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add memo to improve performance.










Even when a component is memoized, it will still re-render when its own state changes. Memoization only has to do with props that are passed to the component from its parent.
If you set a state variable to its current value, React will skip re-rendering your component even without memo. You may still see your component function being called an extra time, but the result will be discarded.
Even when a component is memoized, it will still re-render when a context that it’s using changes. Memoization only has to do with props that are passed to the component from its parent.
To make your component re-render only when a part of some context changes, split your component in two. Read what you need from the context in the outer component, and pass it down to a memoized child as a prop.
When you use memo, your component re-renders whenever any prop is not shallowly equal to what it was previously. This means that React compares every prop in your component with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. Note that Object.is(3, 3) is true, but Object.is({}, {}) is false.
To get the most out of memo, minimize the times that the props change. For example, if the prop is an object, prevent the parent component from re-creating that object every time by using useMemo:
A better way to minimize props changes is to make sure the component accepts the minimum necessary information in its props. For example, it could accept individual values instead of a whole object:
Even individual values can sometimes be projected to ones that change less frequently. For example, here a component accepts a boolean indicating the presence of a value rather than the value itself:
When you need to pass a function to memoized component, either declare it outside your component so that it never changes, or useCallback to cache its definition between re-renders.
In rare cases it may be infeasible to minimize the props changes of a memoized component. In that case, you can provide a custom comparison function, which React will use to compare the old and new props instead of using shallow equality. This function is passed as a second argument to memo. It should return true only if the new props would result in the same output as the old props; otherwise it should return false.
If you do this, use the Performance panel in your browser developer tools to make sure that your comparison function is actually faster than re-rendering the component. You might be surprised.
When you do performance measurements, make sure that React is running in the production mode.
If you provide a custom arePropsEqual implementation, you must compare every prop, including functions. Functions often close over the props and state of parent components. If you return true when oldProps.onClick !== newProps.onClick, your component will keep “seeing” the props and state from a previous render inside its onClick handler, leading to very confusing bugs.
Avoid doing deep equality checks inside arePropsEqual unless you are 100% sure that the data structure you’re working with has a known limited depth. Deep equality checks can become incredibly slow and can freeze your app for many seconds if someone changes the data structure later.
React compares old and new props by shallow equality: that is, it considers whether each new prop is reference-equal to the old prop. If you create a new object or array each time the parent is re-rendered, even if the individual elements are each the same, React will still consider it to be changed. Similarly, if you create a new function when rendering the parent component, React will consider it to have changed even if the function has the same definition. To avoid this, simplify props or memoize props in the parent component.

```
const MemoizedComponent = memo(SomeComponent, arePropsEqual?)
```


```
import { memo } from 'react';

const SomeComponent = memo(function SomeComponent(props) {
  // ...
});

```
const Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) {

Marking a state update as a non-blocking Transition
Marking a state update as a non-blocking Transition
The startTransition function lets you mark a state update as a Transition.
See more examples below.
scope: A function that updates some state by calling one or more set functions. React immediately calls scope with no arguments and marks all state updates scheduled synchronously during the scope function call as Transitions. They will be non-blocking and will not display unwanted loading indicators.
startTransition does not return anything.
startTransition does not provide a way to track whether a Transition is pending. To show a pending indicator while the Transition is ongoing, you need useTransition instead.

You can wrap an update into a Transition only if you have access to the set function of that state. If you want to start a Transition in response to some prop or a custom Hook return value, try useDeferredValue instead.

A state update marked as a Transition will be interrupted by other state updates. For example, if you update a chart component inside a Transition, but then start typing into an input while the chart is in the middle of a re-render, React will restart the rendering work on the chart component after handling the input state update.

You can mark a state update as a Transition by wrapping it in a startTransition call:
Transitions let you keep the user interface updates responsive even on slow devices.
With a Transition, your UI stays responsive in the middle of a re-render. For example, if the user clicks a tab but then change their mind and click another tab, they can do that without waiting for the first re-render to finish.
startTransition is very similar to useTransition, except that it does not provide the isPending flag to track whether a Transition is ongoing. You can call startTransition when useTransition is not available. For example, startTransition works outside components, such as from a data library.
Learn about Transitions and see examples on the useTransition page.

import { startTransition } from 'react';

function TabContainer() {

“Suspense Exception: This is not a real error!”
“Suspense Exception: This is not a real error!”
Call use in your component to read the value of a resource like a Promise or context.
Unlike React Hooks, use can be called within loops and conditional statements like if. Like React Hooks, the function that calls use must be a Component or Hook.
When called with a Promise, the use API integrates with Suspense and error boundaries. The component calling use suspends while the Promise passed to use is pending. If the component that calls use is wrapped in a Suspense boundary, the fallback will be displayed.  Once the Promise is resolved, the Suspense fallback is replaced by the rendered components using the data returned by the use API. If the Promise passed to use is rejected, the fallback of the nearest Error Boundary will be displayed.
See more examples below.
resource: this is the source of the data you want to read a value from. A resource can be a Promise or a context.
The use API returns the value that was read from the resource like the resolved value of a Promise or context.
The use API must be called inside a Component or a Hook.
When fetching data in a Server Component, prefer async and await over use. async and await pick up rendering from the point where await was invoked, whereas use re-renders the component after the data is resolved.
Prefer creating Promises in Server Components and passing them to Client Components over creating Promises in Client Components. Promises created in Client Components are recreated on every render. Promises passed from a Server Component to a Client Component are stable across re-renders. See this example.
When a context is passed to use, it works similarly to useContext. While useContext must be called at the top level of your component, use can be called inside conditionals like if and loops like for. use is preferred over useContext because it is more flexible.
use returns the context value for the context you passed. To determine the context value, React searches the component tree and finds the closest context provider above for that particular context.
To pass context to a Button, wrap it or one of its parent components into the corresponding context provider.
It doesn’t matter how many layers of components there are between the provider and the Button. When a Button anywhere inside of Form calls use(ThemeContext), it will receive ""dark"" as the value.
Unlike useContext, use can be called in conditionals and loops like if.
use is called from inside a if statement, allowing you to conditionally read values from a Context.
Like useContext, use(context) always looks for the closest context provider above the component that calls it. It searches upwards and does not consider context providers in the component from which you’re calling use(context).
Data can be streamed from the server to the client by passing a Promise as a prop from a Server Component to a Client Component.
The Client Component then takes the Promise it received as a prop and passes it to the use API. This allows the Client Component to read the value from the Promise that was initially created by the Server Component.
Because Message is wrapped in Suspense, the fallback will be displayed until the Promise is resolved. When the Promise is resolved, the value will be read by the use API and the Message component will replace the Suspense fallback.
When passing a Promise from a Server Component to a Client Component, its resolved value must be serializable to pass between server and client. Data types like functions aren’t serializable and cannot be the resolved value of such a Promise.


In some cases a Promise passed to use could be rejected. You can handle rejected Promises by either:
Displaying an error to users with an error boundary.
Providing an alternative value with Promise.catch
use cannot be called in a try-catch block. Instead of a try-catch block wrap your component in an Error Boundary, or provide an alternative value to use with the Promise’s .catch method.
If you’d like to display an error to your users when a Promise is rejected, you can use an error boundary. To use an error boundary, wrap the component where you are calling the use API in an error boundary. If the Promise passed to use is rejected the fallback for the error boundary will be displayed.
If you’d like to provide an alternative value when the Promise passed to use is rejected you can use the Promise’s catch method.
To use the Promise’s catch method, call catch on the Promise object. catch takes a single argument: a function that takes an error message as an argument. Whatever is returned by the function passed to catch will be used as the resolved value of the Promise.
You are either calling use outside of a React Component or Hook function, or calling use in a try–catch block. If you are calling use inside a try–catch block, wrap your component in an error boundary, or call the Promise’s catch to catch the error and resolve the Promise with another value. See these examples.
If you are calling use outside a React Component or Hook function, move the use call to a React Component or Hook function.
Instead, call use outside any component closures, where the function that calls use is a Component or Hook.

When a specific instance of a Typed Array is passed to taintObjectReference as object, any other copies of the Typed Array will not be tainted.
experimental_taintObjectReference returns undefined.
Recreating or cloning a tainted object creates a new untainted object which may contain sensitive data. For example, if you have a tainted user object, const userInfo = {name: user.name, ssn: user.ssn} or {...user} will create new objects which are not tainted. taintObjectReference only protects against simple mistakes when the object is passed through to a Client Component unchanged.
Do not rely on just tainting for security. Tainting an object doesn’t prevent leaking of every possible derived value. For example, the clone of a tainted object will create a new untainted object. Using data from a tainted object (e.g. {secret: taintedObj.secret}) will create a new value or object that is not tainted. Tainting is a layer of protection; a secure app will have multiple layers of protection, well designed APIs, and isolation patterns.
A Client Component should never accept objects that carry sensitive data. Ideally, the data fetching functions should not expose data that the current user should not have access to. Sometimes mistakes happen during refactoring. To protect against these mistakes happening down the line we can “taint” the user object in our data API.
Now whenever anyone tries to pass this object to a Client Component, an error will be thrown with the passed in error message instead.

experimental_taintUniqueValue returns undefined.
Deriving new values from tainted values can compromise tainting protection. New values created by uppercasing tainted values, concatenating tainted string values into a larger string, converting tainted values to base64, substringing tainted values, and other similar transformations are not tainted unless you explicitly call taintUniqueValue on these newly created values.
Do not use taintUniqueValue to protect low-entropy values such as PIN codes or phone numbers. If any value in a request is controlled by an attacker, they could infer which value is tainted by enumerating all possible values of the secret.
To ensure that sensitive information such as passwords, session tokens, or other unique values do not inadvertently get passed to Client Components, the taintUniqueValue function provides a layer of protection. When a value is tainted, any attempt to pass it to a Client Component will result in an error.
The lifetime argument defines the duration for which the value remains tainted. For values that should remain tainted indefinitely, objects like globalThis or process can serve as the lifetime argument. These objects have a lifespan that spans the entire duration of your app’s execution.
If the tainted value’s lifespan is tied to a object, the lifetime should be the object that encapsulates the value. This ensures the tainted value remains protected for the lifetime of the encapsulating object.
In this example, the user object serves as the lifetime argument. If this object gets stored in a global cache or is accessible by another request, the session token remains tainted.
Do not rely solely on tainting for security. Tainting a value doesn’t block every possible derived value. For example, creating a new value by upper casing a tainted string will not taint the new value.
In this example, the constant password is tainted. Then password is used to create a new value uppercasePassword by calling the toUpperCase method on password. The newly created uppercasePassword is not tainted.
Other similar ways of deriving new values from tainted values like concatenating it into a larger string, converting it to base64, or returning a substring create untained values.
Tainting only protects against simple mistakes like explicitly passing secret values to the client. Mistakes in calling the taintUniqueValue like using a global store outside of React, without the corresponding lifetime object, can cause the tainted value to become untainted. Tainting is a layer of protection; a secure app will have multiple layers of protection, well designed APIs, and isolation patterns.

Usage
Display a pending state during form submission

Read the form data being submitted
Troubleshooting
status.pending is never true
status.pending is never true
The useFormStatus Hook provides status information of the last form submission.
To get status information, the Submit component must be rendered within a <form>. The Hook returns information like the pending property which tells you if the form is actively submitting.
In the above example, Submit uses this information to disable <button> presses while the form is submitting.
See more examples below.
useFormStatus does not take any parameters.
A status object with the following properties:
pending: A boolean. If true, this means the parent <form> is pending submission. Otherwise, false.
pending: A boolean. If true, this means the parent <form> is pending submission. Otherwise, false.
data: An object implementing the FormData interface that contains the data the parent <form> is submitting. If there is no active submission or no parent <form>, it will be null.
data: An object implementing the FormData interface that contains the data the parent <form> is submitting. If there is no active submission or no parent <form>, it will be null.
method: A string value of either 'get' or 'post'. This represents whether the parent <form> is submitting with either a GET or POST HTTP method. By default, a <form> will use the GET method and can be specified by the method property.
method: A string value of either 'get' or 'post'. This represents whether the parent <form> is submitting with either a GET or POST HTTP method. By default, a <form> will use the GET method and can be specified by the method property.
action: A reference to the function passed to the action prop on the parent <form>. If there is no parent <form>, the property is null. If there is a URI value provided to the action prop, or no action prop specified, status.action will be null.
The useFormStatus Hook must be called from a component that is rendered inside a <form>.
useFormStatus will only return status information for a parent <form>. It will not return status information for any <form> rendered in that same component or children components.
To display a pending state while a form is submitting, you can call the useFormStatus Hook in a component rendered in a <form> and read the pending property returned.
Here, we use the pending property to indicate the form is submitting.
The useFormStatus Hook only returns status information for a parent <form> and not for any <form> rendered in the same component calling the Hook, or child components.
Instead call useFormStatus from inside a component that is located inside <form>.
You can use the data property of the status information returned from useFormStatus to display what data is being submitted by the user.
Here, we have a form where users can request a username. We can use useFormStatus to display a temporary status message confirming what username they have requested.
useFormStatus will only return status information for a parent <form>.
If the component that calls useFormStatus is not nested in a <form>, status.pending will always return false. Verify useFormStatus is called in a component that is a child of a <form> element.
useFormStatus will not track the status of a <form> rendered in the same component. See Pitfall for more details.

```
const { pending, data, method, action } = useFormStatus();
```


```
import { useFormStatus } from ""react-dom"";
import action from './actions';

function Submit() {
  const status = useFormStatus();
  return <button disabled={status.pending}>Submit</button>
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <form action={action}>
      <Submit />
    </form>
  );
}
```


```
function Form() {
  // 🚩 `pending` will never be true
  // useFormStatus does not track the form rendered in this component
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();
  return <form action={submit}></form>;
}
```


```
function Submit() {
  // ✅ `pending` will be derived from the form that wraps the Submit component
  const { pending } = useFormStatus(); 
  return <button disabled={pending}>...</button>;
}

function Form() {
  // This is the <form> `useFormStatus` tracks
  return (
    <form action={submit}>
      <Submit />
    </form>
  );
}

# React DOM Components


# Common components


# Form components


# Resource and Metadata Components


# All HTML components


# Note


# Custom HTML elements


# Note


# All SVG components


# Note

React supports all of the browser built-in HTML and SVG components.
All of the built-in browser components support some props and events.
Common components (e.g. <div>)
This includes React-specific props like ref and dangerouslySetInnerHTML.
These built-in browser components accept user input:
<input>
<select>
<textarea>
They are special in React because passing the value prop to them makes them controlled.
These built-in browser components let you load external resources or annotate the document with metadata:
<link>
<meta>
<script>
<style>
<title>
They are special in React because React can render them into the document head, suspend while resources are loading, and enact other behaviors that are described on the reference page for each specific component.
React supports all built-in browser HTML components. This includes:
<aside>
<audio>

<base>
<bdi>
<bdo>

Similar to the DOM standard, React uses a camelCase convention for prop names. For example, you’ll write tabIndex instead of tabindex. You can convert existing HTML to JSX with an online converter.
If you render a tag with a dash, like <my-element>, React will assume you want to render a custom HTML element. In React, rendering custom elements works differently from rendering built-in browser tags:
All custom element props are serialized to strings and are always set using attributes.
Custom elements accept class rather than className, and for rather than htmlFor.
If you render a built-in browser HTML element with an is attribute, it will also be treated as a custom element.
A future version of React will include more comprehensive support for custom elements.
You can try it by upgrading React packages to the most recent experimental version:
react@experimental
react-dom@experimental
Experimental versions of React may contain bugs. Don’t use them in production.
React supports all built-in browser SVG components. This includes:
<a>
<animate>
<animateMotion>
<animateTransform>
<circle>
<clipPath>
<defs>

xlink:arcrole becomes xlinkArcrole.
xlink:href becomes xlinkHref.
xlink:role becomes xlinkRole.
xlink:show becomes xlinkShow.
xlink:title becomes xlinkTitle.

These special React props are supported for all built-in components:
children: A React node (an element, a string, a number, a portal, an empty node like null, undefined and booleans, or an array of other React nodes). Specifies the content inside the component. When you use JSX, you will usually specify the children prop implicitly by nesting tags like <div><span /></div>.

When you use JSX, you will usually specify the children prop implicitly by nesting tags like <div><span /></div>.
dangerouslySetInnerHTML: An object of the form { __html: '<p>some html</p>' } with a raw HTML string inside. Overrides the innerHTML property of the DOM node and displays the passed HTML inside. This should be used with extreme caution! If the HTML inside isn’t trusted (for example, if it’s based on user data), you risk introducing an XSS vulnerability.

ref: A ref object from useRef or createRef, or a ref callback function, or a string for legacy refs. Your ref will be filled with the DOM element for this node. Read more about manipulating the DOM with refs.
ref: A ref object from useRef or createRef, or a ref callback function, or a string for legacy refs. Your ref will be filled with the DOM element for this node. Read more about manipulating the DOM with refs.
suppressContentEditableWarning: A boolean. If true, suppresses the warning that React shows for elements that both have children and contentEditable={true} (which normally do not work together). Use this if you’re building a text input library that manages the contentEditable content manually.
suppressContentEditableWarning: A boolean. If true, suppresses the warning that React shows for elements that both have children and contentEditable={true} (which normally do not work together). Use this if you’re building a text input library that manages the contentEditable content manually.
suppressHydrationWarning: A boolean. If you use server rendering, normally there is a warning when the server and the client render different content. In some rare cases (like timestamps), it is very hard or impossible to guarantee an exact match. If you set suppressHydrationWarning to true, React will not warn you about mismatches in the attributes and the content of that element. It only works one level deep, and is intended to be used as an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it. Read about suppressing hydration errors.

It only works one level deep, and is intended to be used as an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it. Read about suppressing hydration errors.
style: An object with CSS styles, for example { fontWeight: 'bold', margin: 20 }. Similarly to the DOM style property, the CSS property names need to be written as camelCase, for example fontWeight instead of font-weight. You can pass strings or numbers as values. If you pass a number, like width: 100, React will automatically append px (“pixels”) to the value unless it’s a unitless property. We recommend using style only for dynamic styles where you don’t know the style values ahead of time. In other cases, applying plain CSS classes with className is more efficient.

Read more about className and style.
These standard DOM props are also supported for all built-in components:
accessKey: A string. Specifies a keyboard shortcut for the element. Not generally recommended.
aria-*: ARIA attributes let you specify the accessibility tree information for this element. See ARIA attributes for a complete reference. In React, all ARIA attribute names are exactly the same as in HTML.
autoCapitalize: A string. Specifies whether and how the user input should be capitalized.
className: A string. Specifies the element’s CSS class name. Read more about applying CSS styles.
contentEditable: A boolean. If true, the browser lets the user edit the rendered element directly. This is used to implement rich text input libraries like Lexical. React warns if you try to pass React children to an element with contentEditable={true} because React will not be able to update its content after user edits.
data-*: Data attributes let you attach some string data to the element, for example data-fruit=""banana"". In React, they are not commonly used because you would usually read data from props or state instead.
dir: Either 'ltr' or 'rtl'. Specifies the text direction of the element.
draggable: A boolean. Specifies whether the element is draggable. Part of HTML Drag and Drop API.
enterKeyHint: A string. Specifies which action to present for the enter key on virtual keyboards.
htmlFor: A string. For <label> and <output>, lets you associate the label with some control. Same as for HTML attribute. React uses the standard DOM property names (htmlFor) instead of HTML attribute names.
hidden: A boolean or a string. Specifies whether the element should be hidden.
id: A string. Specifies a unique identifier for this element, which can be used to find it later or connect it with other elements. Generate it with useId to avoid clashes between multiple instances of the same component.
is: A string. If specified, the component will behave like a custom element.
inputMode: A string. Specifies what kind of keyboard to display (for example, text, number or telephone).
itemProp: A string. Specifies which property the element represents for structured data crawlers.
lang: A string. Specifies the language of the element.
onAnimationEnd: An AnimationEvent handler function. Fires when a CSS animation completes.

role: A string. Specifies the element role explicitly for assistive technologies.
slot: A string. Specifies the slot name when using shadow DOM. In React, an equivalent pattern is typically achieved by passing JSX as props, for example <Layout left={<Sidebar />} right={<Content />} />.
spellCheck: A boolean or null. If explicitly set to true or false, enables or disables spellchecking.
tabIndex: A number. Overrides the default Tab button behavior. Avoid using values other than -1 and 0.
title: A string. Specifies the tooltip text for the element.
translate: Either 'yes' or 'no'. Passing 'no' excludes the element content from being translated.
You can also pass custom attributes as props, for example mycustomprop=""someValue"". This can be useful when integrating with third-party libraries. The custom attribute name must be lowercase and must not start with on. The value will be converted to a string. If you pass null or undefined, the custom attribute will be removed.

You cannot pass both children and dangerouslySetInnerHTML at the same time.
Some events (like onAbort and onLoad) don’t bubble in the browser, but bubble in React.
Instead of a ref object (like the one returned by useRef), you may pass a function to the ref attribute.
See an example of using the ref callback.
When the <div> DOM node is added to the screen, React will call your ref callback with the DOM node as the argument. When that <div> DOM node is removed, React will call your ref callback with null.
React will also call your ref callback whenever you pass a different ref callback. In the above example, (node) => { ... } is a different function on every render. When your component re-renders, the previous function will be called with null as the argument, and the next function will be called with the DOM node.
node: A DOM node or null. React will pass you the DOM node when the ref gets attached, and null when the ref gets detached. Unless you pass the same function reference for the ref callback on every render, the callback will get temporarily detached and re-attached during every re-render of the component.
optional cleanup function: When the ref is detached, React will call the cleanup function. If a function is not returned by the ref callback, React will call the callback again with null as the argument when the ref gets detached.
When Strict Mode is on, React will run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic “mirrors” your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, implement the cleanup function.
When you pass a different ref callback, React will call the previous callback’s cleanup function if provided. If not cleanup function is defined, the ref callback will be called with null as the argument. The next function will be called with the DOM node.
Your event handlers will receive a React event object. It is also sometimes known as a “synthetic event”.
It conforms to the same standard as the underlying DOM events, but fixes some browser inconsistencies.
Some React events do not map directly to the browser’s native events. For example in onMouseLeave, e.nativeEvent will point to a mouseout event. The specific mapping is not part of the public API and may change in the future. If you need the underlying browser event for some reason, read it from e.nativeEvent.
React event objects implement some of the standard Event properties:
bubbles: A boolean. Returns whether the event bubbles through the DOM.
cancelable: A boolean. Returns whether the event can be canceled.
currentTarget: A DOM node. Returns the node to which the current handler is attached in the React tree.
defaultPrevented: A boolean. Returns whether preventDefault was called.
eventPhase: A number. Returns which phase the event is currently in.
isTrusted: A boolean. Returns whether the event was initiated by user.
target: A DOM node. Returns the node on which the event has occurred (which could be a distant child).
timeStamp: A number. Returns the time when the event occurred.
Additionally, React event objects provide these properties:
nativeEvent: A DOM Event. The original browser event object.
React event objects implement some of the standard Event methods:
preventDefault(): Prevents the default browser action for the event.
stopPropagation(): Stops the event propagation through the React tree.
Additionally, React event objects provide these methods:
isDefaultPrevented(): Returns a boolean value indicating whether preventDefault was called.
isPropagationStopped(): Returns a boolean value indicating whether stopPropagation was called.
persist(): Not used with React DOM. With React Native, call this to read event’s properties after the event.
isPersistent(): Not used with React DOM. With React Native, returns whether persist has been called.
The values of currentTarget, eventPhase, target, and type reflect the values your React code expects. Under the hood, React attaches event handlers at the root, but this is not reflected in React event objects. For example, e.currentTarget may not be the same as the underlying e.nativeEvent.currentTarget. For polyfilled events, e.type (React event type) may differ from e.nativeEvent.type (underlying type).

In React, you specify a CSS class with className. It works like the class attribute in HTML:
Then you write the CSS rules for it in a separate CSS file:
React does not prescribe how you add CSS files. In the simplest case, you’ll add a <link> tag to your HTML. If you use a build tool or a framework, consult its documentation to learn how to add a CSS file to your project.
Sometimes, the style values depend on data. Use the style attribute to pass some styles dynamically:
In the above example, style={{}} is not a special syntax, but a regular {} object inside the style={ } JSX curly braces. We recommend only using the style attribute when your styles depend on JavaScript variables.




Sometimes, you’ll need to get the browser DOM node associated with a tag in JSX. For example, if you want to focus an <input> when a button is clicked, you need to call focus() on the browser <input> DOM node.
To obtain the browser DOM node for a tag, declare a ref and pass it as the ref attribute to that tag:
React will put the DOM node into inputRef.current after it’s been rendered to the screen.
Read more about manipulating DOM with refs and check out more examples.
For more advanced use cases, the ref attribute also accepts a callback function.
You can pass a raw HTML string to an element like so:
This is dangerous. As with the underlying DOM innerHTML property, you must exercise extreme caution! Unless the markup is coming from a completely trusted source, it is trivial to introduce an XSS vulnerability this way.
For example, if you use a Markdown library that converts Markdown to HTML, you trust that its parser doesn’t contain bugs, and the user only sees their own input, you can display the resulting HTML like this:
The {__html} object should be created as close to where the HTML is generated as possible, like the above example does in the renderMarkdownToHTML function. This ensures that all raw HTML being used in your code is explicitly marked as such, and that only variables that you expect to contain HTML are passed to dangerouslySetInnerHTML. It is not recommended to create the object inline like <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: markup}} />.
To see why rendering arbitrary HTML is dangerous, replace the code above with this:
The code embedded in the HTML will run. A hacker could use this security hole to steal user information or to perform actions on their behalf. Only use dangerouslySetInnerHTML with trusted and sanitized data.
This example shows some common mouse events and when they fire.
This example shows some common pointer events and when they fire.
In React, focus events bubble. You can use the currentTarget and relatedTarget to differentiate if the focusing or blurring events originated from outside of the parent element. The example shows how to detect focusing a child, focusing the parent element, and how to detect focus entering or leaving the whole subtree.
This example shows some common keyboard events and when they fire.

To create interactive controls for submitting information, render the built-in browser <form> component.
See more examples below.
<form> supports all common element props.
action: a URL or function. When a URL is passed to action the form will behave like the HTML form component. When a function is passed to action the function will handle the form submission. The function passed to action may be async and will be called with a single argument containing the form data of the submitted form. The action prop can be overridden by a formAction attribute on a <button>, <input type=""submit"">, or <input type=""image""> component.
When a function is passed to action or formAction the HTTP method will be POST regardless of value of the method prop.
Pass a function to the action prop of form to run the function when the form is submitted. formData will be passed to the function as an argument so you can access the data submitted by the form. This differs from the conventional HTML action, which only accepts URLs.
Render a <form> with an input and submit button. Pass a Server Action (a function marked with 'use server') to the action prop of form to run the function when the form is submitted.
Passing a Server Action to <form action> allow users to submit forms without JavaScript enabled or before the code has loaded. This is beneficial to users who have a slow connection, device, or have JavaScript disabled and is similar to the way forms work when a URL is passed to the action prop.
You can use hidden form fields to provide data to the <form>’s action. The Server Action will be called with the hidden form field data as an instance of FormData.
In lieu of using hidden form fields to provide data to the <form>’s action, you can call the bind method to supply it with extra arguments. This will bind a new argument (productId) to the function in addition to the formData that is passed as an argument to the function.
When <form> is rendered by a Server Component, and a Server Action is passed to the <form>’s action prop, the form is progressively enhanced.
To display a pending state when a form is being submitted, you can call the useFormStatus Hook in a component rendered in a <form> and read the pending property returned.
Here, we use the pending property to indicate the form is submitting.
To learn more about the useFormStatus Hook see the reference documentation.
The useOptimistic Hook provides a way to optimistically update the user interface before a background operation, like a network request, completes. In the context of forms, this technique helps to make apps feel more responsive. When a user submits a form, instead of waiting for the server’s response to reflect the changes, the interface is immediately updated with the expected outcome.
For example, when a user types a message into the form and hits the “Send” button, the useOptimistic Hook allows the message to immediately appear in the list with a “Sending…” label, even before the message is actually sent to a server. This “optimistic” approach gives the impression of speed and responsiveness. The form then attempts to truly send the message in the background. Once the server confirms the message has been received, the “Sending…” label is removed.
In some cases the function called by a <form>’s action prop throws an error. You can handle these errors by wrapping <form> in an Error Boundary. If the function called by a <form>’s action prop throws an error, the fallback for the error boundary will be displayed.
Displaying a form submission error message before the JavaScript bundle loads for progressive enhancement requires that:
<form> be rendered by a Server Component
the function passed to the <form>’s action prop be a Server Action
the useActionState Hook be used to display the error message
useActionState takes two parameters: a Server Action and an initial state. useActionState returns two values, a state variable and an action. The action returned by useActionState should be passed to the action prop of the form. The state variable returned by useActionState can be used to displayed an error message. The value returned by the Server Action passed to useActionState will be used to update the state variable.
Learn more about updating state from a form action with the useActionState docs
Forms can be designed to handle multiple submission actions based on the button pressed by the user. Each button inside a form can be associated with a distinct action or behavior by setting the formAction prop.
When a user taps a specific button, the form is submitted, and a corresponding action, defined by that button’s attributes and action, is executed. For instance, a form might submit an article for review by default but have a separate button with formAction set to save the article as a draft.

```
<form action={search}>
    <input name=""query"" />
    <button type=""submit"">Search</button>
</form>

<input> supports all common element props.
React’s extensions to the formAction prop are currently only available in React’s Canary and experimental channels. In stable releases of React, formAction works only as a built-in browser HTML component. Learn more about React’s release channels here.
formAction: A string or function. Overrides the parent <form action> for type=""submit"" and type=""image"". When a URL is passed to action the form will behave like a standard HTML form. When a function is passed to formAction the function will handle the form submission. See <form action>.
You can make an input controlled by passing one of these props:
checked: A boolean. For a checkbox input or a radio button, controls whether it is selected.
value: A string. For a text input, controls its text. (For a radio button, specifies its form data.)
When you pass either of them, you must also pass an onChange handler that updates the passed value.
These <input> props are only relevant for uncontrolled inputs:
defaultChecked: A boolean. Specifies the initial value for type=""checkbox"" and type=""radio"" inputs.
defaultValue: A string. Specifies the initial value for a text input.
These <input> props are relevant both for uncontrolled and controlled inputs:
accept: A string. Specifies which filetypes are accepted by a type=""file"" input.
alt: A string. Specifies the alternative image text for a type=""image"" input.
capture: A string. Specifies the media (microphone, video, or camera) captured by a type=""file"" input.
autoComplete: A string. Specifies one of the possible autocomplete behaviors.
autoFocus: A boolean. If true, React will focus the element on mount.
dirname: A string. Specifies the form field name for the element’s directionality.
disabled: A boolean. If true, the input will not be interactive and will appear dimmed.
children: <input> does not accept children.
form: A string. Specifies the id of the <form> this input belongs to. If omitted, it’s the closest parent form.
formAction: A string. Overrides the parent <form action> for type=""submit"" and type=""image"".
formEnctype: A string. Overrides the parent <form enctype> for type=""submit"" and type=""image"".
formMethod: A string. Overrides the parent <form method> for type=""submit"" and type=""image"".
formNoValidate: A string. Overrides the parent <form noValidate> for type=""submit"" and type=""image"".
formTarget: A string. Overrides the parent <form target> for type=""submit"" and type=""image"".
height: A string. Specifies the image height for type=""image"".
list: A string. Specifies the id of the <datalist> with the autocomplete options.
max: A number. Specifies the maximum value of numerical and datetime inputs.
maxLength: A number. Specifies the maximum length of text and other inputs.
min: A number. Specifies the minimum value of numerical and datetime inputs.
minLength: A number. Specifies the minimum length of text and other inputs.
multiple: A boolean. Specifies whether multiple values are allowed for <type=""file"" and type=""email"".
name: A string. Specifies the name for this input that’s submitted with the form.
onChange: An Event handler function. Required for controlled inputs. Fires immediately when the input’s value is changed by the user (for example, it fires on every keystroke). Behaves like the browser input event.
onChangeCapture: A version of onChange that fires in the capture phase.
onInput: An Event handler function. Fires immediately when the value is changed by the user. For historical reasons, in React it is idiomatic to use onChange instead which works similarly.
onInputCapture: A version of onInput that fires in the capture phase.
onInvalid: An Event handler function. Fires if an input fails validation on form submit. Unlike the built-in invalid event, the React onInvalid event bubbles.
onInvalidCapture: A version of onInvalid that fires in the capture phase.
onSelect: An Event handler function. Fires after the selection inside the <input> changes. React extends the onSelect event to also fire for empty selection and on edits (which may affect the selection).
onSelectCapture: A version of onSelect that fires in the capture phase.
pattern: A string. Specifies the pattern that the value must match.
placeholder: A string. Displayed in a dimmed color when the input value is empty.
readOnly: A boolean. If true, the input is not editable by the user.
required: A boolean. If true, the value must be provided for the form to submit.
size: A number. Similar to setting width, but the unit depends on the control.
src: A string. Specifies the image source for a type=""image"" input.
step: A positive number or an 'any' string. Specifies the distance between valid values.
type: A string. One of the input types.
width: A string. Specifies the image width for a type=""image"" input.
Checkboxes need checked (or defaultChecked), not value (or defaultValue).
If a text input receives a string value prop, it will be treated as controlled.
If a checkbox or a radio button receives a boolean checked prop, it will be treated as controlled.
An input can’t be both controlled and uncontrolled at the same time.
An input cannot switch between being controlled or uncontrolled over its lifetime.
Every controlled input needs an onChange event handler that synchronously updates its backing value.
To display an input, render an <input> component. By default, it will be a text input. You can pass type=""checkbox"" for a checkbox, type=""radio"" for a radio button, or one of the other input types.
Typically, you will place every <input> inside a <label> tag. This tells the browser that this label is associated with that input. When the user clicks the label, the browser will automatically focus the input. It’s also essential for accessibility: a screen reader will announce the label caption when the user focuses the associated input.
If you can’t nest <input> into a <label>, associate them by passing the same ID to <input id> and <label htmlFor>. To avoid conflicts between multiple instances of one component, generate such an ID with useId.
You can optionally specify the initial value for any input. Pass it as the defaultValue string for text inputs. Checkboxes and radio buttons should specify the initial value with the defaultChecked boolean instead.
Add a <form> around your inputs with a <button type=""submit""> inside. It will call your <form onSubmit> event handler. By default, the browser will send the form data to the current URL and refresh the page. You can override that behavior by calling e.preventDefault(). Read the form data with new FormData(e.target).
Give a name to every <input>, for example <input name=""firstName"" defaultValue=""Taylor"" />. The name you specified will be used as a key in the form data, for example { firstName: ""Taylor"" }.
By default, any <button> inside a <form> will submit it. This can be surprising! If you have your own custom Button React component, consider returning <button type=""button""> instead of <button>. Then, to be explicit, use <button type=""submit""> for buttons that are supposed to submit the form.
An input like <input /> is uncontrolled. Even if you pass an initial value like <input defaultValue=""Initial text"" />, your JSX only specifies the initial value. It does not control what the value should be right now.
To render a controlled input, pass the value prop to it (or checked for checkboxes and radios). React will force the input to always have the value you passed. Usually, you would do this by declaring a state variable:
A controlled input makes sense if you needed state anyway—for example, to re-render your UI on every edit:
It’s also useful if you want to offer multiple ways to adjust the input state (for example, by clicking a button):
The value you pass to controlled components should not be undefined or null. If you need the initial value to be empty (such as with the firstName field below), initialize your state variable to an empty string ('').
If you pass value without onChange, it will be impossible to type into the input. When you control an input by passing some value to it, you force it to always have the value you passed. So if you pass a state variable as a value but forget to update that state variable synchronously during the onChange event handler, React will revert the input after every keystroke back to the value that you specified.
When you use a controlled input, you set the state on every keystroke. If the component containing your state re-renders a large tree, this can get slow. There’s a few ways you can optimize re-rendering performance.
For example, suppose you start with a form that re-renders all page content on every keystroke:
Since <PageContent /> doesn’t rely on the input state, you can move the input state into its own component:
This significantly improves performance because now only SignupForm re-renders on every keystroke.
If there is no way to avoid re-rendering (for example, if PageContent depends on the search input’s value), useDeferredValue lets you keep the controlled input responsive even in the middle of a large re-render.
If you render an input with value but no onChange, you will see an error in the console:
As the error message suggests, if you only wanted to specify the initial value, pass defaultValue instead:
If you want to control this input with a state variable, specify an onChange handler:
If the value is intentionally read-only, add a readOnly prop to suppress the error:
If you render a checkbox with checked but no onChange, you will see an error in the console:
As the error message suggests, if you only wanted to specify the initial value, pass defaultChecked instead:
If you want to control this checkbox with a state variable, specify an onChange handler:
You need to read e.target.checked rather than e.target.value for checkboxes.
If the checkbox is intentionally read-only, add a readOnly prop to suppress the error:
If you control an input, you must update its state variable to the input’s value from the DOM during onChange.
You can’t update it to something other than e.target.value (or e.target.checked for checkboxes):
You also can’t update it asynchronously:
To fix your code, update it synchronously to e.target.value:
If this doesn’t fix the problem, it’s possible that the input gets removed and re-added from the DOM on every keystroke. This can happen if you’re accidentally resetting state on every re-render, for example if the input or one of its parents always receives a different key attribute, or if you nest component function definitions (which is not supported and causes the “inner” component to always be considered a different tree).
If you provide a value to the component, it must remain a string throughout its lifetime.
You cannot pass value={undefined} first and later pass value=""some string"" because React won’t know whether you want the component to be uncontrolled or controlled. A controlled component should always receive a string value, not null or undefined.
If your value is coming from an API or a state variable, it might be initialized to null or undefined. In that case, either set it to an empty string ('') initially, or pass value={someValue ?? ''} to ensure value is a string.
Similarly, if you pass checked to a checkbox, ensure it’s always a boolean.

Controlling a select box with a state variable
To display a select box, render the built-in browser <select> component.
See more examples below.
<select> supports all common element props.
You can make a select box controlled by passing a value prop:
value: A string (or an array of strings for multiple={true}). Controls which option is selected. Every value string match the value of some <option> nested inside the <select>.
When you pass value, you must also pass an onChange handler that updates the passed value.
If your <select> is uncontrolled, you may pass the defaultValue prop instead:
defaultValue: A string (or an array of strings for multiple={true}). Specifies the initially selected option.
These <select> props are relevant both for uncontrolled and controlled select boxes:
autoComplete: A string. Specifies one of the possible autocomplete behaviors.
autoFocus: A boolean. If true, React will focus the element on mount.
children: <select> accepts <option>, <optgroup>, and <datalist> components as children. You can also pass your own components as long as they eventually render one of the allowed components. If you pass your own components that eventually render <option> tags, each <option> you render must have a value.
disabled: A boolean. If true, the select box will not be interactive and will appear dimmed.
form: A string. Specifies the id of the <form> this select box belongs to. If omitted, it’s the closest parent form.
multiple: A boolean. If true, the browser allows multiple selection.
name: A string. Specifies the name for this select box that’s submitted with the form.
onChange: An Event handler function. Required for controlled select boxes. Fires immediately when the user picks a different option. Behaves like the browser input event.
onChangeCapture: A version of onChange that fires in the capture phase.
onInput: An Event handler function. Fires immediately when the value is changed by the user. For historical reasons, in React it is idiomatic to use onChange instead which works similarly.
onInputCapture: A version of onInput that fires in the capture phase.

onInvalidCapture: A version of onInvalid that fires in the capture phase.
required: A boolean. If true, the value must be provided for the form to submit.
size: A number. For multiple={true} selects, specifies the preferred number of initially visible items.
Unlike in HTML, passing a selected attribute to <option> is not supported. Instead, use <select defaultValue> for uncontrolled select boxes and <select value> for controlled select boxes.
If a select box receives a value prop, it will be treated as controlled.
A select box can’t be both controlled and uncontrolled at the same time.
A select box cannot switch between being controlled or uncontrolled over its lifetime.

If you can’t nest <select> into a <label>, associate them by passing the same ID to <select id> and <label htmlFor>. To avoid conflicts between multiple instances of one component, generate such an ID with useId.
By default, the browser will select the first <option> in the list. To select a different option by default, pass that <option>’s value as the defaultValue to the <select> element.
Unlike in HTML, passing a selected attribute to an individual <option> is not supported.
Pass multiple={true} to the <select> to let the user select multiple options. In that case, if you also specify defaultValue to choose the initially selected options, it must be an array.
Add a <form> around your select box with a <button type=""submit""> inside. It will call your <form onSubmit> event handler. By default, the browser will send the form data to the current URL and refresh the page. You can override that behavior by calling e.preventDefault(). Read the form data with new FormData(e.target).
Give a name to your <select>, for example <select name=""selectedFruit"" />. The name you specified will be used as a key in the form data, for example { selectedFruit: ""orange"" }.
If you use <select multiple={true}>, the FormData you’ll read from the form will include each selected value as a separate name-value pair. Look closely at the console logs in the example above.
By default, any <button> inside a <form> will submit it. This can be surprising! If you have your own custom Button React component, consider returning <button type=""button""> instead of <button>. Then, to be explicit, use <button type=""submit""> for buttons that are supposed to submit the form.

You can make a text area controlled by passing a value prop:
value: A string. Controls the text inside the text area.
When you pass value, you must also pass an onChange handler that updates the passed value.
If your <textarea> is uncontrolled, you may pass the defaultValue prop instead:

cols: A number. Specifies the default width in average character widths. Defaults to 20.
disabled: A boolean. If true, the input will not be interactive and will appear dimmed.
form: A string. Specifies the id of the <form> this input belongs to. If omitted, it’s the closest parent form.
maxLength: A number. Specifies the maximum length of text.

readOnly: A boolean. If true, the text area is not editable by the user.
required: A boolean. If true, the value must be provided for the form to submit.
rows: A number. Specifies the default height in average character heights. Defaults to 2.
wrap: Either 'hard', 'soft', or 'off'. Specifies how the text should be wrapped when submitting a form.
Passing children like <textarea>something</textarea> is not allowed. Use defaultValue for initial content.
If a text area receives a string value prop, it will be treated as controlled.
A text area can’t be both controlled and uncontrolled at the same time.
A text area cannot switch between being controlled or uncontrolled over its lifetime.
Every controlled text area needs an onChange event handler that synchronously updates its backing value.
Render <textarea> to display a text area. You can specify its default size with the rows and cols attributes, but by default the user will be able to resize it. To disable resizing, you can specify resize: none in the CSS.
Typically, you will place every <textarea> inside a <label> tag. This tells the browser that this label is associated with that text area. When the user clicks the label, the browser will focus the text area. It’s also essential for accessibility: a screen reader will announce the label caption when the user focuses the text area.

Controlling stylesheet precedence
Deduplicated stylesheet rendering
Annotating specific items within the document with links
To link to external resources such as stylesheets, fonts, and icons, or to annotate the document with link metadata, render the built-in browser <link> component. You can render <link> from any component and React will in most cases place the corresponding DOM element in the document head.
See more examples below.
<link> supports all common element props.
rel: a string, required. Specifies the relationship to the resource. React treats links with rel=""stylesheet"" differently from other links.
These props apply when rel=""stylesheet"":
precedence: a string. Tells React where to rank the <link> DOM node relative to others in the document <head>, which determines which stylesheet can override the other. React will infer that precedence values it discovers first are “lower” and precedence values it discovers later are “higher”. Many style systems can work fine using a single precedence value because style rules are atomic. Stylesheets with the same precedence go together whether they are <link> or inline <style> tags or loaded using preinit functions.
media: a string. Restricts the stylesheet to a certain media query.
title: a string. Specifies the name of an alternative stylesheet.
These props apply when rel=""stylesheet"" but disable React’s special treatment of stylesheets:
disabled: a boolean. Disables the stylesheet.
onError: a function. Called when the stylesheet fails to load.
onLoad: a function. Called when the stylesheet finishes being loaded.
These props apply when rel=""preload"" or rel=""modulepreload"":
as: a string. The type of resource. Its possible values are audio, document, embed, fetch, font, image, object, script, style, track, video, worker.
imageSrcSet: a string. Applicable only when as=""image"". Specifies the source set of the image.
imageSizes: a string. Applicable only when as=""image"". Specifies the sizes of the image.
These props apply when rel=""icon"" or rel=""apple-touch-icon"":
sizes: a string. The sizes of the icon.
These props apply in all cases:
href: a string. The URL of the linked resource.
crossOrigin: a string. The CORS policy to use. Its possible values are anonymous and use-credentials. It is required when as is set to ""fetch"".
referrerPolicy: a string. The Referrer header to send when fetching. Its possible values are no-referrer-when-downgrade (the default), no-referrer, origin, origin-when-cross-origin, and unsafe-url.
fetchPriority: a string. Suggests a relative priority for fetching the resource. The possible values are auto (the default), high, and low.
hrefLang: a string. The language of the linked resource.
integrity: a string. A cryptographic hash of the resource, to verify its authenticity.
type: a string. The MIME type of the linked resource.
Props that are not recommended for use with React:
blocking: a string. If set to ""render"", instructs the browser not to render the page until the stylesheet is loaded. React provides more fine-grained control using Suspense.
React will always place the DOM element corresponding to the <link> component within the document’s <head>, regardless of where in the React tree it is rendered. The <head> is the only valid place for <link> to exist within the DOM, yet it’s convenient and keeps things composable if a component representing a specific page can render <link> components itself.
There are a few exceptions to this:
If the <link> has a rel=""stylesheet"" prop, then it has to also have a precedence prop to get this special behavior. This is because the order of stylesheets within the document is significant, so React needs to know how to order this stylesheet relative to others, which you specify using the precedence prop. If the precedence prop is omitted, there is no special behavior.
If the <link> has an itemProp prop, there is no special behavior, because in this case it doesn’t apply to the document but instead represents metadata about a specific part of the page.
If the <link> has an onLoad or onError prop, because in that case you are managing the loading of the linked resource manually within your React component.
In addition, if the <link> is to a stylesheet (namely, it has rel=""stylesheet"" in its props), React treats it specially in the following ways:
The component that renders <link> will suspend while the stylesheet is loading.
If multiple components render links to the same stylesheet, React will de-duplicate them and only put a single link into the DOM. Two links are considered the same if they have the same href prop.
There are two exception to this special behavior:
If the link doesn’t have a precedence prop, there is no special behavior, because the order of stylesheets within the document is significant, so React needs to know how to order this stylesheet relative to others, which you specify using the precedence prop.
If you supply any of the onLoad, onError, or disabled props, there is no special behavior, because these props indicate that you are managing the loading of the stylesheet manually within your component.
This special treatment comes with two caveats:
React will ignore changes to props after the link has been rendered. (React will issue a warning in development if this happens.)
React may leave the link in the DOM even after the component that rendered it has been unmounted.
You can annotate the document with links to related resources such as an icon, canonical URL, or pingback. React will place this metadata within the document <head> regardless of where in the React tree it is rendered.
If a component depends on a certain stylesheet in order to be displayed correctly, you can render a link to that stylesheet within the component. Your component will suspend while the stylesheet is loading. You must supply the precedence prop, which tells React where to place this stylesheet relative to others — stylesheets with higher precedence can override those with lower precedence.
When you want to use a stylesheet, it can be beneficial to call the preinit function. Calling this function may allow the browser to start fetching the stylesheet earlier than if you just render a <link> component, for example by sending an HTTP Early Hints response.
Stylesheets can conflict with each other, and when they do, the browser goes with the one that comes later in the document. React lets you control the order of stylesheets with the precedence prop. In this example, two components render stylesheets, and the one with the higher precedence goes later in the document even though the component that renders it comes earlier.
If you render the same stylesheet from multiple components, React will place only a single <link> in the document head.
You can use the <link> component with the itemProp prop to annotate specific items within the document with links to related resources. In this case, React will not place these annotations within the document <head> but will place them like any other React component.

React’s extensions to <script> are currently only available in React’s canary and experimental channels. In stable releases of React <script> works only as a built-in browser HTML component. Learn more about React’s release channels here.

Rendering an inline script
To add inline or external scripts to your document, render the built-in browser <script> component. You can render <script> from any component and React will in certain cases place the corresponding DOM element in the document head and de-duplicate identical scripts.
See more examples below.
<script> supports all common element props.
It should have either children or a src prop.
children: a string. The source code of an inline script.
src: a string. The URL of an external script.
Other supported props:
async: a boolean. Allows the browser to defer execution of the script until the rest of the document has been processed — the preferred behavior for performance.
crossOrigin: a string. The CORS policy to use. Its possible values are anonymous and use-credentials.
fetchPriority: a string. Lets the browser rank scripts in priority when fetching multiple scripts at the same time. Can be ""high"", ""low"", or ""auto"" (the default).
integrity: a string. A cryptographic hash of the script, to verify its authenticity.
noModule: a boolean. Disables the script in browsers that support ES modules — allowing for a fallback script for browsers that do not.
nonce: a string. A cryptographic nonce to allow the resource when using a strict Content Security Policy.
referrer: a string. Says what Referer header to send when fetching the script and any resources that the script fetches in turn.
type: a string. Says whether the script is a classic script, ES module, or import map.
Props that disable React’s special treatment of scripts:
onError: a function. Called when the script fails to load.
onLoad: a function. Called when the script finishes being loaded.
Props that are not recommended for use with React:
blocking: a string. If set to ""render"", instructs the browser not to render the page until the scriptsheet is loaded. React provides more fine-grained control using Suspense.
defer: a string. Prevents the browser from executing the script until the document is done loading. Not compatible with streaming server-rendered components. Use the async prop instead.
React can move <script> components to the document’s <head> and de-duplicate identical scripts.
To opt into this behavior, provide the src and async={true} props. React will de-duplicate scripts if they have the same src. The async prop must be true to allow scripts to be safely moved.
This special treatment comes with two caveats:
React will ignore changes to props after the script has been rendered. (React will issue a warning in development if this happens.)
React may leave the script in the DOM even after the component that rendered it has been unmounted. (This has no effect as scripts just execute once when they are inserted into the DOM.)
If a component depends on certain scripts in order to be displayed correctly, you can render a <script> within the component.
However, the component might be committed before the script has finished loading.
You can start depending on the script content once the load event is fired e.g. by using the onLoad prop.
React will de-duplicate scripts that have the same src, inserting only one of them into the DOM even if multiple components render it.
When you want to use a script, it can be beneficial to call the preinit function. Calling this function may allow the browser to start fetching the script earlier than if you just render a <script> component, for example by sending an HTTP Early Hints response.
To include an inline script, render the <script> component with the script source code as its children. Inline scripts are not de-duplicated or moved to the document <head>.

```
<script> alert(""hi!"") </script>
```


```
<script> alert(""hi!"") </script>
<script src=""script.js"" />

# React DOM APIs

# Deprecated APIs


# Deprecated

The react-dom package contains methods that are only supported for the web applications (which run in the browser DOM environment). They are not supported for React Native.
These APIs can be imported from your components. They are rarely used:
createPortal lets you render child components in a different part of the DOM tree.
flushSync lets you force React to flush a state update and update the DOM synchronously.
These APIs can be used to make apps faster by pre-loading resources such as scripts, stylesheets, and fonts as soon as you know you need them, for example before navigating to another page where the resources will be used.
React-based frameworks frequently handle resource loading for you, so you might not have to call these APIs yourself. Consult your framework’s documentation for details.
prefetchDNS lets you prefetch the IP address of a DNS domain name that you expect to connect to.
preconnect lets you connect to a server you expect to request resources from, even if you don’t know what resources you’ll need yet.
preload lets you fetch a stylesheet, font, image, or external script that you expect to use.
preloadModule lets you fetch an ESM module that you expect to use.
preinit lets you fetch and evaluate an external script or fetch and insert a stylesheet.
preinitModule lets you fetch and evaluate an ESM module.
The react-dom package provides two additional entry points:
react-dom/client contains APIs to render React components on the client (in the browser).
react-dom/server contains APIs to render React components on the server.
These APIs will be removed in a future major version of React.
findDOMNode finds the closest DOM node corresponding to a class component instance.
hydrate mounts a tree into the DOM created from server HTML. Deprecated in favor of hydrateRoot.

Rendering React components into non-React server markup
Rendering React components into non-React DOM nodes
To create a portal, call createPortal, passing some JSX, and the DOM node where it should be rendered:
See more examples below.
A portal only changes the physical placement of the DOM node. In every other way, the JSX you render into a portal acts as a child node of the React component that renders it. For example, the child can access the context provided by the parent tree, and events bubble up from children to parents according to the React tree.
children: Anything that can be rendered with React, such as a piece of JSX (e.g. <div /> or <SomeComponent />), a Fragment (<>...</>), a string or a number, or an array of these.
children: Anything that can be rendered with React, such as a piece of JSX (e.g. <div /> or <SomeComponent />), a Fragment (<>...</>), a string or a number, or an array of these.
domNode: Some DOM node, such as those returned by document.getElementById(). The node must already exist. Passing a different DOM node during an update will cause the portal content to be recreated.
domNode: Some DOM node, such as those returned by document.getElementById(). The node must already exist. Passing a different DOM node during an update will cause the portal content to be recreated.
optional key: A unique string or number to be used as the portal’s key.
optional key: A unique string or number to be used as the portal’s key.
createPortal returns a React node that can be included into JSX or returned from a React component. If React encounters it in the render output, it will place the provided children inside the provided domNode.
Events from portals propagate according to the React tree rather than the DOM tree. For example, if you click inside a portal, and the portal is wrapped in <div onClick>, that onClick handler will fire. If this causes issues, either stop the event propagation from inside the portal, or move the portal itself up in the React tree.
Portals let your components render some of their children into a different place in the DOM. This lets a part of your component “escape” from whatever containers it may be in. For example, a component can display a modal dialog or a tooltip that appears above and outside of the rest of the page.
To create a portal, render the result of createPortal with some JSX and the DOM node where it should go:
React will put the DOM nodes for the JSX you passed inside of the DOM node you provided.
Without a portal, the second <p> would be placed inside the parent <div>, but the portal “teleported” it into the document.body:
Notice how the second paragraph visually appears outside the parent <div> with the border. If you inspect the DOM structure with developer tools, you’ll see that the second <p> got placed directly into the <body>:
A portal only changes the physical placement of the DOM node. In every other way, the JSX you render into a portal acts as a child node of the React component that renders it. For example, the child can access the context provided by the parent tree, and events still bubble up from children to parents according to the React tree.
You can use a portal to create a modal dialog that floats above the rest of the page, even if the component that summons the dialog is inside a container with overflow: hidden or other styles that interfere with the dialog.
In this example, the two containers have styles that disrupt the modal dialog, but the one rendered into a portal is unaffected because, in the DOM, the modal is not contained within the parent JSX elements.
It’s important to make sure that your app is accessible when using portals. For instance, you may need to manage keyboard focus so that the user can move the focus in and out of the portal in a natural way.
Follow the WAI-ARIA Modal Authoring Practices when creating modals. If you use a community package, ensure that it is accessible and follows these guidelines.
Portals can be useful if your React root is only part of a static or server-rendered page that isn’t built with React. For example, if your page is built with a server framework like Rails, you can create areas of interactivity within static areas such as sidebars. Compared with having multiple separate React roots, portals let you treat the app as a single React tree with shared state even though its parts render to different parts of the DOM.
You can also use a portal to manage the content of a DOM node that’s managed outside of React. For example, suppose you’re integrating with a non-React map widget and you want to render React content inside a popup. To do this, declare a popupContainer state variable to store the DOM node you’re going to render into:
When you create the third-party widget, store the DOM node returned by the widget so you can render into it:
This lets you use createPortal to render React content into popupContainer once it becomes available:
Here is a complete example you can play with:

```
<div>
  <SomeComponent />
  {createPortal(children, domNode, key?)}
</div>
```


```
import { createPortal } from 'react-dom';

// ...

<div>
  <p>This child is placed in the parent div.</p>
  {createPortal(
    <p>This child is placed in the document body.</p>,

      )}
    </div>
  );

# Pitfall

Using flushSync is uncommon and can hurt the performance of your app.
flushSync lets you force React to flush any updates inside the provided callback synchronously. This ensures that the DOM is updated immediately.
Reference
flushSync(callback)
flushSync(callback)
Usage
Flushing updates for third-party integrations
Flushing updates for third-party integrations
Call flushSync to force React to flush any pending work and update the DOM synchronously.
Most of the time, flushSync can be avoided. Use flushSync as last resort.
See more examples below.
callback: A function. React will immediately call this callback and flush any updates it contains synchronously. It may also flush any pending updates, or Effects, or updates inside of Effects. If an update suspends as a result of this flushSync call, the fallbacks may be re-shown.
flushSync returns undefined.
flushSync can significantly hurt performance. Use sparingly.
flushSync may force pending Suspense boundaries to show their fallback state.
flushSync may run pending Effects and synchronously apply any updates they contain before returning.
flushSync may flush updates outside the callback when necessary to flush the updates inside the callback. For example, if there are pending updates from a click, React may flush those before flushing the updates inside the callback.
When integrating with third-party code such as browser APIs or UI libraries, it may be necessary to force React to flush updates. Use flushSync to force React to flush any state updates inside the callback synchronously:
This ensures that, by the time the next line of code runs, React has already updated the DOM.
Using flushSync is uncommon, and using it often can significantly hurt the performance of your app. If your app only uses React APIs, and does not integrate with third-party libraries, flushSync should be unnecessary.
However, it can be helpful for integrating with third-party code like browser APIs.
Some browser APIs expect results inside of callbacks to be written to the DOM synchronously, by the end of the callback, so the browser can do something with the rendered DOM. In most cases, React handles this for you automatically. But in some cases it may be necessary to force a synchronous update.
For example, the browser onbeforeprint API allows you to change the page immediately before the print dialog opens. This is useful for applying custom print styles that allow the document to display better for printing. In the example below, you use flushSync inside of the onbeforeprint callback to immediately “flush” the React state to the DOM. Then, by the time the print dialog opens, isPrinting displays “yes”:
Without flushSync, the print dialog will display isPrinting as “no”. This is because React batches the updates asynchronously and the print dialog is displayed before the state is updated.
flushSync can significantly hurt performance, and may unexpectedly force pending Suspense boundaries to show their fallback state.
Most of the time, flushSync can be avoided, so use flushSync as a last resort.

```
flushSync(callback)
```


```
import { flushSync } from 'react-dom';

flushSync(() => {
  setSomething(123);
});
```


```
flushSync(() => {
  setSomething(123);
});
// By this line, the DOM is updated.

Call findDOMNode to find the browser DOM node for a given React class component instance.
See more examples below.
componentInstance: An instance of the Component subclass. For example, this inside a class component.
findDOMNode returns the first closest browser DOM node within the given componentInstance. When a component renders to null, or renders false, findDOMNode returns null. When a component renders to a string, findDOMNode returns a text DOM node containing that value.
A component may return an array or a Fragment with multiple children. In that case findDOMNode, will return the DOM node corresponding to the first non-empty child.

Call findDOMNode with a class component instance (usually, this) to find the DOM node it has rendered.
Here, the input variable will be set to the <input> DOM element. This lets you do something with it. For example, when clicking “Show example” below mounts the input, input.select() selects all text in the input:
Code using findDOMNode is fragile because the connection between the JSX node and the code manipulating the corresponding DOM node is not explicit. For example, try wrapping this <input /> into a <div>:
This will break the code because now, findDOMNode(this) finds the <div> DOM node, but the code expects an <input> DOM node. To avoid these kinds of problems, use createRef to manage a specific DOM node.
In this example, findDOMNode is no longer used. Instead, inputRef = createRef(null) is defined as an instance field on the class. To read the DOM node from it, you can use this.inputRef.current. To attach it to the JSX, you render <input ref={this.inputRef} />. This connects the code using the DOM node to its JSX:
In modern React without class components, the equivalent code would call useRef instead:
Read more about manipulating the DOM with refs.
In this example, findDOMNode(this) finds a DOM node that belongs to another component. The AutoselectingInput renders MyInput, which is your own component that renders a browser <input>.
Notice that calling findDOMNode(this) inside AutoselectingInput still gives you the DOM <input>—even though the JSX for this <input> is hidden inside the MyInput component. This seems convenient for the above example, but it leads to fragile code. Imagine that you wanted to edit MyInput later and add a wrapper <div> around it. This would break the code of AutoselectingInput (which expects to find an <input>).
To replace findDOMNode in this example, the two components need to coordinate:
AutoSelectingInput should declare a ref, like in the earlier example, and pass it to <MyInput>.
MyInput should be declared with forwardRef to take that ref and forward it down to the <input> node.
This version does that, so it no longer needs findDOMNode:
Here is how this code would look like with function components instead of classes:
Sometimes a component needs to know the position and size of its children. This makes it tempting to find the children with findDOMNode(this), and then use DOM methods like getBoundingClientRect for measurements.
There is currently no direct equivalent for this use case, which is why findDOMNode is deprecated but is not yet removed completely from React. In the meantime, you can try rendering a wrapper <div> node around the content as a workaround, and getting a ref to that node. However, extra wrappers can break styling.
This also applies to focusing and scrolling to arbitrary children.

```
const domNode = findDOMNode(componentInstance)
```


```
import { findDOMNode } from 'react-dom';

const domNode = findDOMNode(componentInstance);
```


```
class AutoselectingInput extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    const input = findDOMNode(this);
    input.select()
  }

  render() {
    return <input defaultValue=""Hello"" />
  }
}
```


```
<div ref={someRef}>
  {children}
</div>

Hydrating server-rendered HTML
Suppressing unavoidable hydration mismatch errors
Handling different client and server content
Call hydrate in React 17 and below to “attach” React to existing HTML that was already rendered by React in a server environment.
React will attach to the HTML that exists inside the domNode, and take over managing the DOM inside it. An app fully built with React will usually only have one hydrate call with its root component.
See more examples below.
reactNode: The “React node” used to render the existing HTML. This will usually be a piece of JSX like <App /> which was rendered with a ReactDOM Server method such as renderToString(<App />) in React 17.

optional: callback: A function. If passed, React will call it after your component is hydrated.
optional: callback: A function. If passed, React will call it after your component is hydrated.
hydrate returns null.
hydrate expects the rendered content to be identical with the server-rendered content. React can patch up differences in text content, but you should treat mismatches as bugs and fix them.
In development mode, React warns about mismatches during hydration. There are no guarantees that attribute differences will be patched up in case of mismatches. This is important for performance reasons because in most apps, mismatches are rare, and so validating all markup would be prohibitively expensive.
You’ll likely have only one hydrate call in your app. If you use a framework, it might do this call for you.
If your app is client-rendered with no HTML rendered already, using hydrate() is not supported. Use render() (for React 17 and below) or createRoot() (for React 18+) instead.
Call hydrate to attach a React component into a server-rendered browser DOM node.
Using hydrate() to render a client-only app (an app without server-rendered HTML) is not supported. Use render() (in React 17 and below) or createRoot() (in React 18+) instead.
In React, “hydration” is how React “attaches” to existing HTML that was already rendered by React in a server environment. During hydration, React will attempt to attach event listeners to the existing markup and take over rendering the app on the client.
In apps fully built with React, you will usually only hydrate one “root”, once at startup for your entire app.
Usually you shouldn’t need to call hydrate again or to call it in more places. From this point on, React will be managing the DOM of your application. To update the UI, your components will use state.
For more information on hydration, see the docs for hydrateRoot.
If a single element’s attribute or text content is unavoidably different between the server and the client (for example, a timestamp), you may silence the hydration mismatch warning.
To silence hydration warnings on an element, add suppressHydrationWarning={true}:
This only works one level deep, and is intended to be an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it. Unless it’s text content, React still won’t attempt to patch it up, so it may remain inconsistent until future updates.
If you intentionally need to render something different on the server and the client, you can do a two-pass rendering. Components that render something different on the client can read a state variable like isClient, which you can set to true in an Effect:
This way the initial render pass will render the same content as the server, avoiding mismatches, but an additional pass will happen synchronously right after hydration.
This approach makes hydration slower because your components have to render twice. Be mindful of the user experience on slow connections. The JavaScript code may load significantly later than the initial HTML render, so rendering a different UI immediately after hydration may feel jarring to the user.

```
hydrate(reactNode, domNode, callback?)
```


```
import { hydrate } from 'react-dom';

hydrate(reactNode, domNode);
```


```
import { hydrate } from 'react-dom';

hydrate(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

referrerPolicy: a string. The Referrer header to send when fetching. Its possible values are no-referrer-when-downgrade (the default), no-referrer, origin, origin-when-cross-origin, and unsafe-url.
integrity: a string. A cryptographic hash of the resource, to verify its authenticity.

nonce: a string. A cryptographic nonce to allow the resource when using a strict Content Security Policy.
fetchPriority: a string. Suggests a relative priority for fetching the resource. The possible values are auto (the default), high, and low.
imageSrcSet: a string. For use only with as: ""image"". Specifies the source set of the image.
imageSizes: a string. For use only with as: ""image"". Specifies the sizes of the image.
preload returns nothing.
Multiple equivalent calls to preload have the same effect as a single call. Calls to preload are considered equivalent according to the following rules:
Two calls are equivalent if they have the same href, except:

In the browser, you can call preload in any situation: while rendering a component, in an Effect, in an event handler, and so on.
In server-side rendering or when rendering Server Components, preload only has an effect if you call it while rendering a component or in an async context originating from rendering a component. Any other calls will be ignored.
Call preload when rendering a component if you know that it or its children will use a specific resource.
If you want the browser to start executing the script immediately (rather than just downloading it), use preinit instead. If you want to load an ESM module, use preloadModule.
Call preload in an event handler before transitioning to a page or state where external resources will be needed. This gets the process started earlier than if you call it during the rendering of the new page or state.

Call render to display a React component inside a browser DOM node.
In apps fully built with React, you will usually only do this once at startup—to render the “root” component.
Usually you shouldn’t need to call render again or to call it in more places. From this point on, React will be managing the DOM of your application. To update the UI, your components will use state.
If your page isn’t fully built with React, call render for each top-level piece of UI managed by React.
You can destroy the rendered trees with unmountComponentAtNode().
You can call render more than once on the same DOM node. As long as the component tree structure matches up with what was previously rendered, React will preserve the state. Notice how you can type in the input, which means that the updates from repeated render calls every second are not destructive:
It is uncommon to call render multiple times. Usually, you’ll update state inside your components instead.

Call createRoot to create a React root for displaying content inside a browser DOM element.
React will create a root for the domNode, and take over managing the DOM inside it. After you’ve created a root, you need to call root.render to display a React component inside of it:
An app fully built with React will usually only have one createRoot call for its root component. A page that uses “sprinkles” of React for parts of the page may have as many separate roots as needed.
See more examples below.
domNode: A DOM element. React will create a root for this DOM element and allow you to call functions on the root, such as render to display rendered React content.
domNode: A DOM element. React will create a root for this DOM element and allow you to call functions on the root, such as render to display rendered React content.
optional options: An object with options for this React root.
Canary only optional onCaughtError: Callback called when React catches an error in an Error Boundary. Called with the error caught by the Error Boundary, and an errorInfo object containing the componentStack.
Canary only optional onUncaughtError: Callback called when an error is thrown and not caught by an Error Boundary. Called with the error that was thrown, and an errorInfo object containing the componentStack.
optional onRecoverableError: Callback called when React automatically recovers from errors. Called with an error React throws, and an errorInfo object containing the componentStack. Some recoverable errors may include the original error cause as error.cause.
optional identifierPrefix: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by useId. Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page.

optional identifierPrefix: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by useId. Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page.
createRoot returns an object with two methods: render and unmount.
If your app is server-rendered, using createRoot() is not supported. Use hydrateRoot() instead.
You’ll likely have only one createRoot call in your app. If you use a framework, it might do this call for you.
When you want to render a piece of JSX in a different part of the DOM tree that isn’t a child of your component (for example, a modal or a tooltip), use createPortal instead of createRoot.
Call root.render to display a piece of JSX (“React node”) into the React root’s browser DOM node.
React will display <App /> in the root, and take over managing the DOM inside it.
See more examples below.
reactNode: A React node that you want to display. This will usually be a piece of JSX like <App />, but you can also pass a React element constructed with createElement(), a string, a number, null, or undefined.
root.render returns undefined.

Calling render on the same root again is similar to calling the set function on the root component: React avoids unnecessary DOM updates.
Call root.unmount to destroy a rendered tree inside a React root.
An app fully built with React will usually not have any calls to root.unmount.
This is mostly useful if your React root’s DOM node (or any of its ancestors) may get removed from the DOM by some other code. For example, imagine a jQuery tab panel that removes inactive tabs from the DOM. If a tab gets removed, everything inside it (including the React roots inside) would get removed from the DOM as well. In that case, you need to tell React to “stop” managing the removed root’s content by calling root.unmount. Otherwise, the components inside the removed root won’t know to clean up and free up global resources like subscriptions.
Calling root.unmount will unmount all the components in the root and “detach” React from the root DOM node, including removing any event handlers or state in the tree.
root.unmount does not accept any parameters.
root.unmount returns undefined.
Calling root.unmount will unmount all the components in the tree and “detach” React from the root DOM node.
Calling root.unmount will unmount all the components in the tree and “detach” React from the root DOM node.
Once you call root.unmount you cannot call root.render again on the same root. Attempting to call root.render on an unmounted root will throw a “Cannot update an unmounted root” error. However, you can create a new root for the same DOM node after the previous root for that node has been unmounted.
Once you call root.unmount you cannot call root.render again on the same root. Attempting to call root.render on an unmounted root will throw a “Cannot update an unmounted root” error. However, you can create a new root for the same DOM node after the previous root for that node has been unmounted.
If your app is fully built with React, create a single root for your entire app.
Usually, you only need to run this code once at startup. It will:
Find the browser DOM node defined in your HTML.
Display the React component for your app inside.
If your app is fully built with React, you shouldn’t need to create any more roots, or to call root.render again.
From this point on, React will manage the DOM of your entire app. To add more components, nest them inside the App component. When you need to update the UI, each of your components can do this by using state. When you need to display extra content like a modal or a tooltip outside the DOM node, render it with a portal.
When your HTML is empty, the user sees a blank page until the app’s JavaScript code loads and runs:
This can feel very slow! To solve this, you can generate the initial HTML from your components on the server or during the build. Then your visitors can read text, see images, and click links before any of the JavaScript code loads. We recommend using a framework that does this optimization out of the box. Depending on when it runs, this is called server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG).
Apps using server rendering or static generation must call hydrateRoot instead of createRoot. React will then hydrate (reuse) the DOM nodes from your HTML instead of destroying and re-creating them.
If your page isn’t fully built with React, you can call createRoot multiple times to create a root for each top-level piece of UI managed by React. You can display different content in each root by calling root.render.
Here, two different React components are rendered into two DOM nodes defined in the index.html file:
You could also create a new DOM node with document.createElement() and add it to the document manually.
To remove the React tree from the DOM node and clean up all the resources used by it, call root.unmount.
This is mostly useful if your React components are inside an app written in a different framework.
You can call render more than once on the same root. As long as the component tree structure matches up with what was previously rendered, React will preserve the state. Notice how you can type in the input, which means that the updates from repeated render calls every second in this example are not destructive:
It is uncommon to call render multiple times. Usually, your components will update state instead.
onUncaughtError is only available in the latest React Canary release.
By default, React will log all uncaught errors to the console. To implement your own error reporting, you can provide the optional onUncaughtError root option:
The onUncaughtError option is a function called with two arguments:
The error that was thrown.
An errorInfo object that contains the componentStack of the error.
You can use the onUncaughtError root option to display error dialogs:
onCaughtError is only available in the latest React Canary release.
By default, React will log all errors caught by an Error Boundary to console.error. To override this behavior, you can provide the optional onCaughtError root option to handle errors caught by an Error Boundary:
The onCaughtError option is a function called with two arguments:
The error that was caught by the boundary.
An errorInfo object that contains the componentStack of the error.
You can use the onCaughtError root option to display error dialogs or filter known errors from logging:
React may automatically render a component a second time to attempt to recover from an error thrown in render. If successful, React will log a recoverable error to the console to notify the developer. To override this behavior, you can provide the optional onRecoverableError root option:
The onRecoverableError option is a function called with two arguments:
The error that React throws. Some errors may include the original cause as error.cause.
An errorInfo object that contains the componentStack of the error.
You can use the onRecoverableError root option to display error dialogs:
Make sure you haven’t forgotten to actually render your app into the root:
Until you do that, nothing is displayed.
A common mistake is to pass the options for createRoot to root.render(...):
To fix, pass the root options to createRoot(...), not root.render(...):
This error means that whatever you’re passing to createRoot is not a DOM node.
If you’re not sure what’s happening, try logging it:
For example, if domNode is null, it means that getElementById returned null. This will happen if there is no node in the document with the given ID at the time of your call. There may be a few reasons for it:
The ID you’re looking for might differ from the ID you used in the HTML file. Check for typos!
Your bundle’s <script> tag cannot “see” any DOM nodes that appear after it in the HTML.
Another common way to get this error is to write createRoot(<App />) instead of createRoot(domNode).
This error means that whatever you’re passing to root.render is not a React component.
This may happen if you call root.render with Component instead of <Component />:
Or if you pass a function to root.render, instead of the result of calling it:
If your app is server-rendered and includes the initial HTML generated by React, you might notice that creating a root and calling root.render deletes all that HTML, and then re-creates all the DOM nodes from scratch. This can be slower, resets focus and scroll positions, and may lose other user input.
Server-rendered apps must use hydrateRoot instead of createRoot:
Note that its API is different. In particular, usually there will be no further root.render call.

I’m getting an error: “You passed a second argument to root.render”
Call hydrateRoot to “attach” React to existing HTML that was already rendered by React in a server environment.
React will attach to the HTML that exists inside the domNode, and take over managing the DOM inside it. An app fully built with React will usually only have one hydrateRoot call with its root component.
See more examples below.
domNode: A DOM element that was rendered as the root element on the server.
domNode: A DOM element that was rendered as the root element on the server.
reactNode: The “React node” used to render the existing HTML. This will usually be a piece of JSX like <App /> which was rendered with a ReactDOM Server method such as renderToPipeableStream(<App />).
reactNode: The “React node” used to render the existing HTML. This will usually be a piece of JSX like <App /> which was rendered with a ReactDOM Server method such as renderToPipeableStream(<App />).
optional options: An object with options for this React root.
Canary only optional onCaughtError: Callback called when React catches an error in an Error Boundary. Called with the error caught by the Error Boundary, and an errorInfo object containing the componentStack.
Canary only optional onUncaughtError: Callback called when an error is thrown and not caught by an Error Boundary. Called with the error that was thrown and an errorInfo object containing the componentStack.
optional onRecoverableError: Callback called when React automatically recovers from errors. Called with the error React throws, and an errorInfo object containing the componentStack. Some recoverable errors may include the original error cause as error.cause.
optional identifierPrefix: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by useId. Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page. Must be the same prefix as used on the server.

optional identifierPrefix: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by useId. Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page. Must be the same prefix as used on the server.
hydrateRoot returns an object with two methods: render and unmount.
hydrateRoot() expects the rendered content to be identical with the server-rendered content. You should treat mismatches as bugs and fix them.
In development mode, React warns about mismatches during hydration. There are no guarantees that attribute differences will be patched up in case of mismatches. This is important for performance reasons because in most apps, mismatches are rare, and so validating all markup would be prohibitively expensive.
You’ll likely have only one hydrateRoot call in your app. If you use a framework, it might do this call for you.
If your app is client-rendered with no HTML rendered already, using hydrateRoot() is not supported. Use createRoot() instead.
Call root.render to update a React component inside a hydrated React root for a browser DOM element.
React will update <App /> in the hydrated root.
See more examples below.
reactNode: A “React node” that you want to update. This will usually be a piece of JSX like <App />, but you can also pass a React element constructed with createElement(), a string, a number, null, or undefined.
root.render returns undefined.
If you call root.render before the root has finished hydrating, React will clear the existing server-rendered HTML content and switch the entire root to client rendering.
Call root.unmount to destroy a rendered tree inside a React root.
An app fully built with React will usually not have any calls to root.unmount.
This is mostly useful if your React root’s DOM node (or any of its ancestors) may get removed from the DOM by some other code. For example, imagine a jQuery tab panel that removes inactive tabs from the DOM. If a tab gets removed, everything inside it (including the React roots inside) would get removed from the DOM as well. You need to tell React to “stop” managing the removed root’s content by calling root.unmount. Otherwise, the components inside the removed root won’t clean up and free up resources like subscriptions.
Calling root.unmount will unmount all the components in the root and “detach” React from the root DOM node, including removing any event handlers or state in the tree.
root.unmount does not accept any parameters.
root.unmount returns undefined.
Calling root.unmount will unmount all the components in the tree and “detach” React from the root DOM node.
Calling root.unmount will unmount all the components in the tree and “detach” React from the root DOM node.
Once you call root.unmount you cannot call root.render again on the root. Attempting to call root.render on an unmounted root will throw a “Cannot update an unmounted root” error.
Once you call root.unmount you cannot call root.render again on the root. Attempting to call root.render on an unmounted root will throw a “Cannot update an unmounted root” error.
If your app’s HTML was generated by react-dom/server, you need to hydrate it on the client.
This will hydrate the server HTML inside the browser DOM node with the React component for your app. Usually, you will do it once at startup. If you use a framework, it might do this behind the scenes for you.
To hydrate your app, React will “attach” your components’ logic to the initial generated HTML from the server. Hydration turns the initial HTML snapshot from the server into a fully interactive app that runs in the browser.
You shouldn’t need to call hydrateRoot again or to call it in more places. From this point on, React will be managing the DOM of your application. To update the UI, your components will use state instead.
The React tree you pass to hydrateRoot needs to produce the same output as it did on the server.
This is important for the user experience. The user will spend some time looking at the server-generated HTML before your JavaScript code loads. Server rendering creates an illusion that the app loads faster by showing the HTML snapshot of its output. Suddenly showing different content breaks that illusion. This is why the server render output must match the initial render output on the client.
The most common causes leading to hydration errors include:
Extra whitespace (like newlines) around the React-generated HTML inside the root node.
Using checks like typeof window !== 'undefined' in your rendering logic.
Using browser-only APIs like window.matchMedia in your rendering logic.
Rendering different data on the server and the client.
React recovers from some hydration errors, but you must fix them like other bugs. In the best case, they’ll lead to a slowdown; in the worst case, event handlers can get attached to the wrong elements.
Apps fully built with React can render the entire document as JSX, including the <html> tag:
To hydrate the entire document, pass the document global as the first argument to hydrateRoot:
If a single element’s attribute or text content is unavoidably different between the server and the client (for example, a timestamp), you may silence the hydration mismatch warning.
To silence hydration warnings on an element, add suppressHydrationWarning={true}:
This only works one level deep, and is intended to be an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it. Unless it’s text content, React still won’t attempt to patch it up, so it may remain inconsistent until future updates.
If you intentionally need to render something different on the server and the client, you can do a two-pass rendering. Components that render something different on the client can read a state variable like isClient, which you can set to true in an Effect:
This way the initial render pass will render the same content as the server, avoiding mismatches, but an additional pass will happen synchronously right after hydration.
This approach makes hydration slower because your components have to render twice. Be mindful of the user experience on slow connections. The JavaScript code may load significantly later than the initial HTML render, so rendering a different UI immediately after hydration may also feel jarring to the user.
After the root has finished hydrating, you can call root.render to update the root React component. Unlike with createRoot, you don’t usually need to do this because the initial content was already rendered as HTML.
If you call root.render at some point after hydration, and the component tree structure matches up with what was previously rendered, React will preserve the state. Notice how you can type in the input, which means that the updates from repeated render calls every second in this example are not destructive:
It is uncommon to call root.render on a hydrated root. Usually, you’ll update state inside one of the components instead.
onUncaughtError is only available in the latest React Canary release.
By default, React will log all uncaught errors to the console. To implement your own error reporting, you can provide the optional onUncaughtError root option:
The onUncaughtError option is a function called with two arguments:
The error that was thrown.
An errorInfo object that contains the componentStack of the error.
You can use the onUncaughtError root option to display error dialogs:
onCaughtError is only available in the latest React Canary release.
By default, React will log all errors caught by an Error Boundary to console.error. To override this behavior, you can provide the optional onCaughtError root option for errors caught by an Error Boundary:
The onCaughtError option is a function called with two arguments:
The error that was caught by the boundary.
An errorInfo object that contains the componentStack of the error.
You can use the onCaughtError root option to display error dialogs or filter known errors from logging:
When React encounters a hydration mismatch, it will automatically attempt to recover by rendering on the client. By default, React will log hydration mismatch errors to console.error. To override this behavior, you can provide the optional onRecoverableError root option:
The onRecoverableError option is a function called with two arguments:
The error React throws. Some errors may include the original cause as error.cause.
An errorInfo object that contains the componentStack of the error.
You can use the onRecoverableError root option to display error dialogs for hydration mismatches:
A common mistake is to pass the options for hydrateRoot to root.render(...):
To fix, pass the root options to hydrateRoot(...), not root.render(...):

```

The react-dom/server APIs let you render React components to HTML on the server. These APIs are only used on the server at the top level of your app to generate the initial HTML. A framework may call them for you. Most of your components don’t need to import or use them.
These methods are only available in the environments with Node.js Streams:
renderToPipeableStream renders a React tree to a pipeable Node.js Stream.
renderToStaticNodeStream renders a non-interactive React tree to a Node.js Readable Stream.
These methods are only available in the environments with Web Streams, which includes browsers, Deno, and some modern edge runtimes:
renderToReadableStream renders a React tree to a Readable Web Stream.
These methods can be used in the environments that don’t support streams:
renderToString renders a React tree to a string.
renderToStaticMarkup renders a non-interactive React tree to a string.
They have limited functionality compared to the streaming APIs.
These APIs will be removed in a future major version of React.

This API is specific to Node.js. Environments with Web Streams, like Deno and modern edge runtimes, should use renderToReadableStream instead.
Call renderToPipeableStream to render your React tree as HTML into a Node.js Stream.
On the client, call hydrateRoot to make the server-generated HTML interactive.
See more examples below.
reactNode: A React node you want to render to HTML. For example, a JSX element like <App />. It is expected to represent the entire document, so the App component should render the <html> tag.
reactNode: A React node you want to render to HTML. For example, a JSX element like <App />. It is expected to represent the entire document, so the App component should render the <html> tag.
optional options: An object with streaming options.
optional bootstrapScriptContent: If specified, this string will be placed in an inline <script> tag.
optional bootstrapScripts: An array of string URLs for the <script> tags to emit on the page. Use this to include the <script> that calls hydrateRoot. Omit it if you don’t want to run React on the client at all.
optional bootstrapModules: Like bootstrapScripts, but emits <script type=""module""> instead.
optional identifierPrefix: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by useId. Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page. Must be the same prefix as passed to hydrateRoot.
optional namespaceURI: A string with the root namespace URI for the stream. Defaults to regular HTML. Pass 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' for SVG or 'http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' for MathML.
optional nonce: A nonce string to allow scripts for script-src Content-Security-Policy.
optional onAllReady: A callback that fires when all rendering is complete, including both the shell and all additional content. You can use this instead of onShellReady for crawlers and static generation. If you start streaming here, you won’t get any progressive loading. The stream will contain the final HTML.
optional onError: A callback that fires whenever there is a server error, whether recoverable or not. By default, this only calls console.error. If you override it to log crash reports, make sure that you still call console.error. You can also use it to adjust the status code before the shell is emitted.
optional onShellReady: A callback that fires right after the initial shell has been rendered. You can set the status code and call pipe here to start streaming. React will stream the additional content after the shell along with the inline <script> tags that replace the HTML loading fallbacks with the content.
optional onShellError: A callback that fires if there was an error rendering the initial shell. It receives the error as an argument. No bytes were emitted from the stream yet, and neither onShellReady nor onAllReady will get called, so you can output a fallback HTML shell.
optional progressiveChunkSize: The number of bytes in a chunk. Read more about the default heuristic.
optional options: An object with streaming options.
optional bootstrapScriptContent: If specified, this string will be placed in an inline <script> tag.
optional bootstrapScripts: An array of string URLs for the <script> tags to emit on the page. Use this to include the <script> that calls hydrateRoot. Omit it if you don’t want to run React on the client at all.
optional bootstrapModules: Like bootstrapScripts, but emits <script type=""module""> instead.

optional progressiveChunkSize: The number of bytes in a chunk. Read more about the default heuristic.
renderToPipeableStream returns an object with two methods:
pipe outputs the HTML into the provided Writable Node.js Stream. Call pipe in onShellReady if you want to enable streaming, or in onAllReady for crawlers and static generation.
abort lets you abort server rendering and render the rest on the client.
Call renderToPipeableStream to render your React tree as HTML into a Node.js Stream:
Along with the root component, you need to provide a list of bootstrap <script> paths. Your root component should return the entire document including the root <html> tag.
For example, it might look like this:
React will inject the doctype and your bootstrap <script> tags into the resulting HTML stream:
On the client, your bootstrap script should hydrate the entire document with a call to hydrateRoot:
This will attach event listeners to the server-generated HTML and make it interactive.






Streaming allows the user to start seeing the content even before all the data has loaded on the server. For example, consider a profile page that shows a cover, a sidebar with friends and photos, and a list of posts:
Imagine that loading data for <Posts /> takes some time. Ideally, you’d want to show the rest of the profile page content to the user without waiting for the posts. To do this, wrap Posts in a <Suspense> boundary:
This tells React to start streaming the HTML before Posts loads its data. React will send the HTML for the loading fallback (PostsGlimmer) first, and then, when Posts finishes loading its data, React will send the remaining HTML along with an inline <script> tag that replaces the loading fallback with that HTML. From the user’s perspective, the page will first appear with the PostsGlimmer, later replaced by the Posts.
You can further nest <Suspense> boundaries to create a more granular loading sequence:
In this example, React can start streaming the page even earlier. Only ProfileLayout and ProfileCover must finish rendering first because they are not wrapped in any <Suspense> boundary. However, if Sidebar, Friends, or Photos need to load some data, React will send the HTML for the BigSpinner fallback instead. Then, as more data becomes available, more content will continue to be revealed until all of it becomes visible.
Streaming does not need to wait for React itself to load in the browser, or for your app to become interactive. The HTML content from the server will get progressively revealed before any of the <script> tags load.
Read more about how streaming HTML works.
Only Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component. They include:
Data fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js
Lazy-loading component code with lazy
Reading the value of a Promise with use
Suspense does not detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.
The exact way you would load data in the Posts component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.
Suspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.
The part of your app outside of any <Suspense> boundaries is called the shell:
It determines the earliest loading state that the user may see:
If you wrap the whole app into a <Suspense> boundary at the root, the shell will only contain that spinner. However, that’s not a pleasant user experience because seeing a big spinner on the screen can feel slower and more annoying than waiting a bit more and seeing the real layout. This is why usually you’ll want to place the <Suspense> boundaries so that the shell feels minimal but complete—like a skeleton of the entire page layout.
The onShellReady callback fires when the entire shell has been rendered. Usually, you’ll start streaming then:
By the time onShellReady fires, components in nested <Suspense> boundaries might still be loading data.
By default, all errors on the server are logged to console. You can override this behavior to log crash reports:
If you provide a custom onError implementation, don’t forget to also log errors to the console like above.
In this example, the shell contains ProfileLayout, ProfileCover, and PostsGlimmer:
If an error occurs while rendering those components, React won’t have any meaningful HTML to send to the client. Override onShellError to send a fallback HTML that doesn’t rely on server rendering as the last resort:
If there is an error while generating the shell, both onError and onShellError will fire. Use onError for error reporting and use onShellError to send the fallback HTML document. Your fallback HTML does not have to be an error page. Instead, you may include an alternative shell that renders your app on the client only.
In this example, the <Posts /> component is wrapped in <Suspense> so it is not a part of the shell:
If an error happens in the Posts component or somewhere inside it, React will try to recover from it:
It will emit the loading fallback for the closest <Suspense> boundary (PostsGlimmer) into the HTML.
It will “give up” on trying to render the Posts content on the server anymore.
When the JavaScript code loads on the client, React will retry rendering Posts on the client.
If retrying rendering Posts on the client also fails, React will throw the error on the client. As with all the errors thrown during rendering, the closest parent error boundary determines how to present the error to the user. In practice, this means that the user will see a loading indicator until it is certain that the error is not recoverable.
If retrying rendering Posts on the client succeeds, the loading fallback from the server will be replaced with the client rendering output. The user will not know that there was a server error. However, the server onError callback and the client onRecoverableError callbacks will fire so that you can get notified about the error.
Streaming introduces a tradeoff. You want to start streaming the page as early as possible so that the user can see the content sooner. However, once you start streaming, you can no longer set the response status code.
By dividing your app into the shell (above all <Suspense> boundaries) and the rest of the content, you’ve already solved a part of this problem. If the shell errors, you’ll get the onShellError callback which lets you set the error status code. Otherwise, you know that the app may recover on the client, so you can send “OK”.
If a component outside the shell (i.e. inside a <Suspense> boundary) throws an error, React will not stop rendering. This means that the onError callback will fire, but you will still get onShellReady instead of onShellError. This is because React will try to recover from that error on the client, as described above.
However, if you’d like, you can use the fact that something has errored to set the status code:
This will only catch errors outside the shell that happened while generating the initial shell content, so it’s not exhaustive. If knowing whether an error occurred for some content is critical, you can move it up into the shell.
You can create your own Error subclasses and use the instanceof operator to check which error is thrown. For example, you can define a custom NotFoundError and throw it from your component. Then your onError, onShellReady, and onShellError callbacks can do something different depending on the error type:
Keep in mind that once you emit the shell and start streaming, you can’t change the status code.
Streaming offers a better user experience because the user can see the content as it becomes available.
However, when a crawler visits your page, or if you’re generating the pages at the build time, you might want to let all of the content load first and then produce the final HTML output instead of revealing it progressively.
You can wait for all the content to load using the onAllReady callback:
A regular visitor will get a stream of progressively loaded content. A crawler will receive the final HTML output after all the data loads. However, this also means that the crawler will have to wait for all data, some of which might be slow to load or error. Depending on your app, you could choose to send the shell to the crawlers too.
You can force the server rendering to “give up” after a timeout:
React will flush the remaining loading fallbacks as HTML, and will attempt to render the rest on the client.

Aborting server rendering
This API depends on Web Streams. For Node.js, use renderToPipeableStream instead.
Call renderToReadableStream to render your React tree as HTML into a Readable Web Stream.
On the client, call hydrateRoot to make the server-generated HTML interactive.
See more examples below.
reactNode: A React node you want to render to HTML. For example, a JSX element like <App />. It is expected to represent the entire document, so the App component should render the <html> tag.
reactNode: A React node you want to render to HTML. For example, a JSX element like <App />. It is expected to represent the entire document, so the App component should render the <html> tag.
optional options: An object with streaming options.
optional bootstrapScriptContent: If specified, this string will be placed in an inline <script> tag.
optional bootstrapScripts: An array of string URLs for the <script> tags to emit on the page. Use this to include the <script> that calls hydrateRoot. Omit it if you don’t want to run React on the client at all.
optional bootstrapModules: Like bootstrapScripts, but emits <script type=""module""> instead.
optional identifierPrefix: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by useId. Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page. Must be the same prefix as passed to hydrateRoot.
optional namespaceURI: A string with the root namespace URI for the stream. Defaults to regular HTML. Pass 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' for SVG or 'http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' for MathML.
optional nonce: A nonce string to allow scripts for script-src Content-Security-Policy.
optional onError: A callback that fires whenever there is a server error, whether recoverable or not. By default, this only calls console.error. If you override it to log crash reports, make sure that you still call console.error. You can also use it to adjust the status code before the shell is emitted.
optional progressiveChunkSize: The number of bytes in a chunk. Read more about the default heuristic.
optional signal: An abort signal that lets you abort server rendering and render the rest on the client.
optional options: An object with streaming options.
optional bootstrapScriptContent: If specified, this string will be placed in an inline <script> tag.
optional bootstrapScripts: An array of string URLs for the <script> tags to emit on the page. Use this to include the <script> that calls hydrateRoot. Omit it if you don’t want to run React on the client at all.
optional bootstrapModules: Like bootstrapScripts, but emits <script type=""module""> instead.
optional identifierPrefix: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by useId. Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page. Must be the same prefix as passed to hydrateRoot.
optional namespaceURI: A string with the root namespace URI for the stream. Defaults to regular HTML. Pass 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' for SVG or 'http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' for MathML.

optional signal: An abort signal that lets you abort server rendering and render the rest on the client.
renderToReadableStream returns a Promise:
If rendering the shell is successful, that Promise will resolve to a Readable Web Stream.
If rendering the shell fails, the Promise will be rejected. Use this to output a fallback shell.
The returned stream has an additional property:
allReady: A Promise that resolves when all rendering is complete, including both the shell and all additional content. You can await stream.allReady before returning a response for crawlers and static generation. If you do that, you won’t get any progressive loading. The stream will contain the final HTML.
Call renderToReadableStream to render your React tree as HTML into a Readable Web Stream:
Along with the root component, you need to provide a list of bootstrap <script> paths. Your root component should return the entire document including the root <html> tag.
For example, it might look like this:
React will inject the doctype and your bootstrap <script> tags into the resulting HTML stream:
On the client, your bootstrap script should hydrate the entire document with a call to hydrateRoot:
This will attach event listeners to the server-generated HTML and make it interactive.






Streaming allows the user to start seeing the content even before all the data has loaded on the server. For example, consider a profile page that shows a cover, a sidebar with friends and photos, and a list of posts:
Imagine that loading data for <Posts /> takes some time. Ideally, you’d want to show the rest of the profile page content to the user without waiting for the posts. To do this, wrap Posts in a <Suspense> boundary:
This tells React to start streaming the HTML before Posts loads its data. React will send the HTML for the loading fallback (PostsGlimmer) first, and then, when Posts finishes loading its data, React will send the remaining HTML along with an inline <script> tag that replaces the loading fallback with that HTML. From the user’s perspective, the page will first appear with the PostsGlimmer, later replaced by the Posts.
You can further nest <Suspense> boundaries to create a more granular loading sequence:
In this example, React can start streaming the page even earlier. Only ProfileLayout and ProfileCover must finish rendering first because they are not wrapped in any <Suspense> boundary. However, if Sidebar, Friends, or Photos need to load some data, React will send the HTML for the BigSpinner fallback instead. Then, as more data becomes available, more content will continue to be revealed until all of it becomes visible.
Streaming does not need to wait for React itself to load in the browser, or for your app to become interactive. The HTML content from the server will get progressively revealed before any of the <script> tags load.
Read more about how streaming HTML works.
Only Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component. They include:
Data fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js
Lazy-loading component code with lazy
Reading the value of a Promise with use
Suspense does not detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.
The exact way you would load data in the Posts component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.
Suspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.
The part of your app outside of any <Suspense> boundaries is called the shell:
It determines the earliest loading state that the user may see:
If you wrap the whole app into a <Suspense> boundary at the root, the shell will only contain that spinner. However, that’s not a pleasant user experience because seeing a big spinner on the screen can feel slower and more annoying than waiting a bit more and seeing the real layout. This is why usually you’ll want to place the <Suspense> boundaries so that the shell feels minimal but complete—like a skeleton of the entire page layout.
The async call to renderToReadableStream will resolve to a stream as soon as the entire shell has been rendered. Usually, you’ll start streaming then by creating and returning a response with that stream:
By the time the stream is returned, components in nested <Suspense> boundaries might still be loading data.
By default, all errors on the server are logged to console. You can override this behavior to log crash reports:
If you provide a custom onError implementation, don’t forget to also log errors to the console like above.
In this example, the shell contains ProfileLayout, ProfileCover, and PostsGlimmer:
If an error occurs while rendering those components, React won’t have any meaningful HTML to send to the client. Wrap your renderToReadableStream call in a try...catch to send a fallback HTML that doesn’t rely on server rendering as the last resort:
If there is an error while generating the shell, both onError and your catch block will fire. Use onError for error reporting and use the catch block to send the fallback HTML document. Your fallback HTML does not have to be an error page. Instead, you may include an alternative shell that renders your app on the client only.
In this example, the <Posts /> component is wrapped in <Suspense> so it is not a part of the shell:
If an error happens in the Posts component or somewhere inside it, React will try to recover from it:
It will emit the loading fallback for the closest <Suspense> boundary (PostsGlimmer) into the HTML.
It will “give up” on trying to render the Posts content on the server anymore.
When the JavaScript code loads on the client, React will retry rendering Posts on the client.
If retrying rendering Posts on the client also fails, React will throw the error on the client. As with all the errors thrown during rendering, the closest parent error boundary determines how to present the error to the user. In practice, this means that the user will see a loading indicator until it is certain that the error is not recoverable.
If retrying rendering Posts on the client succeeds, the loading fallback from the server will be replaced with the client rendering output. The user will not know that there was a server error. However, the server onError callback and the client onRecoverableError callbacks will fire so that you can get notified about the error.
Streaming introduces a tradeoff. You want to start streaming the page as early as possible so that the user can see the content sooner. However, once you start streaming, you can no longer set the response status code.
By dividing your app into the shell (above all <Suspense> boundaries) and the rest of the content, you’ve already solved a part of this problem. If the shell errors, your catch block will run which lets you set the error status code. Otherwise, you know that the app may recover on the client, so you can send “OK”.
If a component outside the shell (i.e. inside a <Suspense> boundary) throws an error, React will not stop rendering. This means that the onError callback will fire, but your code will continue running without getting into the catch block. This is because React will try to recover from that error on the client, as described above.
However, if you’d like, you can use the fact that something has errored to set the status code:
This will only catch errors outside the shell that happened while generating the initial shell content, so it’s not exhaustive. If knowing whether an error occurred for some content is critical, you can move it up into the shell.
You can create your own Error subclasses and use the instanceof operator to check which error is thrown. For example, you can define a custom NotFoundError and throw it from your component.

However, when a crawler visits your page, or if you’re generating the pages at the build time, you might want to let all of the content load first and then produce the final HTML output instead of revealing it progressively.
You can wait for all the content to load by awaiting the stream.allReady Promise:
A regular visitor will get a stream of progressively loaded content. A crawler will receive the final HTML output after all the data loads. However, this also means that the crawler will have to wait for all data, some of which might be slow to load or error. Depending on your app, you could choose to send the shell to the crawlers too.
You can force the server rendering to “give up” after a timeout:

When possible, we recommend using these fully-featured alternatives:

If you use Deno or a modern edge runtime with Web Streams, use renderToReadableStream.
You can continue using renderToString if your server environment does not support streams.
Sometimes, renderToString is used on the client to convert some component to HTML.
Importing react-dom/server on the client unnecessarily increases your bundle size and should be avoided. If you need to render some component to HTML in the browser, use createRoot and read HTML from the DOM:
The flushSync call is necessary so that the DOM is updated before reading its innerHTML property.
renderToString does not fully support Suspense.
If some component suspends (for example, because it’s defined with lazy or fetches data), renderToString will not wait for its content to resolve. Instead, renderToString will find the closest <Suspense> boundary above it and render its fallback prop in the HTML. The content will not appear until the client code loads.
To solve this, use one of the recommended streaming solutions. They can stream content in chunks as it resolves on the server so that the user sees the page being progressively filled in before the client code loads.

# Rules of React


# Note


# Components and Hooks must be pure


# React calls Components and Hooks


# Rules of Hooks

Just as different programming languages have their own ways of expressing concepts, React has its own idioms — or rules — for how to express patterns in a way that is easy to understand and yields high-quality applications.
Components and Hooks must be pure
React calls Components and Hooks
Rules of Hooks
To learn more about expressing UIs with React, we recommend reading Thinking in React.
This section describes the rules you need to follow to write idiomatic React code. Writing idiomatic React code can help you write well organized, safe, and composable applications. These properties make your app more resilient to changes and makes it easier to work with other developers, libraries, and tools.
These rules are known as the Rules of React. They are rules – and not just guidelines – in the sense that if they are broken, your app likely has bugs. Your code also becomes unidiomatic and harder to understand and reason about.
We strongly recommend using Strict Mode alongside React’s ESLint plugin to help your codebase follow the Rules of React. By following the Rules of React, you’ll be able to find and address these bugs and keep your application maintainable.
Purity in Components and Hooks is a key rule of React that makes your app predictable, easy to debug, and allows React to automatically optimize your code.
Components must be idempotent – React components are assumed to always return the same output with respect to their inputs – props, state, and context.
Side effects must run outside of render – Side effects should not run in render, as React can render components multiple times to create the best possible user experience.
Props and state are immutable – A component’s props and state are immutable snapshots with respect to a single render. Never mutate them directly.
Return values and arguments to Hooks are immutable – Once values are passed to a Hook, you should not modify them. Like props in JSX, values become immutable when passed to a Hook.
Values are immutable after being passed to JSX – Don’t mutate values after they’ve been used in JSX. Move the mutation before the JSX is created.
React is responsible for rendering components and hooks when necessary to optimize the user experience. It is declarative: you tell React what to render in your component’s logic, and React will figure out how best to display it to your user.
Never call component functions directly – Components should only be used in JSX. Don’t call them as regular functions.
Never pass around hooks as regular values – Hooks should only be called inside of components. Never pass it around as a regular value.
Hooks are defined using JavaScript functions, but they represent a special type of reusable UI logic with restrictions on where they can be called. You need to follow the Rules of Hooks when using them.
Only call Hooks at the top level – Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns.
Only call Hooks from React functions – Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions.""""""",635,3233,react

Pure functions only perform a calculation and nothing more. It makes your code easier to understand, debug, and allows React to automatically optimize your components and Hooks correctly.
This reference page covers advanced topics and requires familiarity with the concepts covered in the Keeping Components Pure page.

Components and Hooks must be idempotent
Side effects must run outside of render

One of the key concepts that makes React, React is purity. A pure component or hook is one that is:
Idempotent – You always get the same result every time you run it with the same inputs – props, state, context for component inputs; and arguments for hook inputs.
Has no side effects in render – Code with side effects should run separately from rendering. For example as an event handler – where the user interacts with the UI and causes it to update; or as an Effect – which runs after render.
Does not mutate non-local values: Components and Hooks should never modify values that aren’t created locally in render.
When render is kept pure, React can understand how to prioritize which updates are most important for the user to see first. This is made possible because of render purity: since components don’t have side effects in render, React can pause rendering components that aren’t as important to update, and only come back to them later when it’s needed.
Concretely, this means that rendering logic can be run multiple times in a way that allows React to give your user a pleasant user experience. However, if your component has an untracked side effect – like modifying the value of a global variable during render – when React runs your rendering code again, your side effects will be triggered in a way that won’t match what you want. This often leads to unexpected bugs that can degrade how your users experience your app. You can see an example of this in the Keeping Components Pure page.
React is declarative: you tell React what to render, and React will figure out how best to display it to your user. To do this, React has a few phases where it runs your code. You don’t need to know about all of these phases to use React well. But at a high level, you should know about what code runs in render, and what runs outside of it.
Rendering refers to calculating what the next version of your UI should look like. After rendering, Effects are flushed (meaning they are run until there are no more left) and may update the calculation if the Effects have impacts on layout. React takes this new calculation and compares it to the calculation used to create the previous version of your UI, then commits just the minimum changes needed to the DOM (what your user actually sees) to catch it up to the latest version.


Components must always return the same output with respect to their inputs – props, state, and context. This is known as idempotency. Idempotency is a term popularized in functional programming. It refers to the idea that you always get the same result every time you run that piece of code with the same inputs.
This means that all code that runs during render must also be idempotent in order for this rule to hold. For example, this line of code is not idempotent (and therefore, neither is the component):
new Date() is not idempotent as it always returns the current date and changes its result every time it’s called. When you render the above component, the time displayed on the screen will stay stuck on the time that the component was rendered. Similarly, functions like Math.random() also aren’t idempotent, because they return different results every time they’re called, even when the inputs are the same.
This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use non-idempotent functions like new Date() at all – you should just avoid using them during render. In this case, we can synchronize the latest date to this component using an Effect:
By wrapping the non-idempotent new Date() call in an Effect, it moves that calculation outside of rendering.
If you don’t need to synchronize some external state with React, you can also consider using an event handler if it only needs to be updated in response to a user interaction.
Side effects should not run in render, as React can render components multiple times to create the best possible user experience.
Side effects are a broader term than Effects. Effects specifically refer to code that’s wrapped in useEffect, while a side effect is a general term for code that has any observable effect other than its primary result of returning a value to the caller.
Side effects are typically written inside of event handlers or Effects. But never during render.
While render must be kept pure, side effects are necessary at some point in order for your app to do anything interesting, like showing something on the screen! The key point of this rule is that side effects should not run in render, as React can render components multiple times. In most cases, you’ll use event handlers to handle side effects. Using an event handler explicitly tells React that this code doesn’t need to run during render, keeping render pure. If you’ve exhausted all options – and only as a last resort – you can also handle side effects using useEffect.
One common example of a side effect is mutation, which in JavaScript refers to changing the value of a non-primitive value. In general, while mutation is not idiomatic in React, local mutation is absolutely fine:
There is no need to contort your code to avoid local mutation. Array.map could also be used here for brevity, but there is nothing wrong with creating a local array and then pushing items into it during render.
Even though it looks like we are mutating items, the key point to note is that this code only does so locally – the mutation isn’t “remembered” when the component is rendered again. In other words, items only stays around as long as the component does. Because items is always recreated every time <FriendList /> is rendered, the component will always return the same result.
On the other hand, if items was created outside of the component, it holds on to its previous values and remembers changes:
When <FriendList /> runs again, we will continue appending friends to items every time that component is run, leading to multiple duplicated results. This version of <FriendList /> has observable side effects during render and breaks the rule.
Lazy initialization is also fine despite not being fully “pure”:
Side effects that are directly visible to the user are not allowed in the render logic of React components. In other words, merely calling a component function shouldn’t by itself produce a change on the screen.
One way to achieve the desired result of updating document.title outside of render is to synchronize the component with document.
As long as calling a component multiple times is safe and doesn’t affect the rendering of other components, React doesn’t care if it’s 100% pure in the strict functional programming sense of the word. It is more important that components must be idempotent.
A component’s props and state are immutable snapshots. Never mutate them directly. Instead, pass new props down, and use the setter function from useState.
You can think of the props and state values as snapshots that are updated after rendering. For this reason, you don’t modify the props or state variables directly: instead you pass new props, or use the setter function provided to you to tell React that state needs to update the next time the component is rendered.
Props are immutable because if you mutate them, the application will produce inconsistent output, which can be hard to debug since it may or may not work depending on the circumstance.
useState returns the state variable and a setter to update that state.
Rather than updating the state variable in-place, we need to update it using the setter function that is returned by useState. Changing values on the state variable doesn’t cause the component to update, leaving your users with an outdated UI. Using the setter function informs React that the state has changed, and that we need to queue a re-render to update the UI.
Once values are passed to a hook, you should not modify them. Like props in JSX, values become immutable when passed to a hook.
One important principle in React is local reasoning: the ability to understand what a component or hook does by looking at its code in isolation. Hooks should be treated like “black boxes” when they are called. For example, a custom hook might have used its arguments as dependencies to memoize values inside it:
If you were to mutate the Hooks arguments, the custom hook’s memoization will become incorrect,  so it’s important to avoid doing that.
Similarly, it’s important to not modify the return values of Hooks, as they may have been memoized.
Don’t mutate values after they’ve been used in JSX. Move the mutation before the JSX is created.
When you use JSX in an expression, React may eagerly evaluate the JSX before the component finishes rendering. This means that mutating values after they’ve been passed to JSX can lead to outdated UIs, as React won’t know to update the component’s output.

# React calls Components and Hooks


# Never call component functions directly


# Never pass around Hooks as regular values


# Don’t dynamically mutate a Hook


# Don’t dynamically use Hooks

React is responsible for rendering components and Hooks when necessary to optimize the user experience. It is declarative: you tell React what to render in your component’s logic, and React will figure out how best to display it to your user.
Never call component functions directly
Never pass around Hooks as regular values
Don’t dynamically mutate a Hook
Don’t dynamically use Hooks
Don’t dynamically mutate a Hook
Don’t dynamically use Hooks
Components should only be used in JSX. Don’t call them as regular functions. React should call it.
React must decide when your component function is called during rendering. In React, you do this using JSX.
If a component contains Hooks, it’s easy to violate the Rules of Hooks when components are called directly in a loop or conditionally.
Letting React orchestrate rendering also allows a number of benefits:
Components become more than functions. React can augment them with features like local state through Hooks that are tied to the component’s identity in the tree.
Component types participate in reconciliation. By letting React call your components, you also tell it more about the conceptual structure of your tree. For example, when you move from rendering <Feed> to the <Profile> page, React won’t attempt to re-use them.
React can enhance your user experience. For example, it can let the browser do some work between component calls so that re-rendering a large component tree doesn’t block the main thread.
A better debugging story. If components are first-class citizens that the library is aware of, we can build rich developer tools for introspection in development.
More efficient reconciliation. React can decide exactly which components in the tree need re-rendering and skip over the ones that don’t. That makes your app faster and more snappy.
Hooks should only be called inside of components or Hooks. Never pass it around as a regular value.
Hooks allow you to augment a component with React features. They should always be called as a function, and never passed around as a regular value. This enables local reasoning, or the ability for developers to understand everything a component can do by looking at that component in isolation.
Breaking this rule will cause React to not automatically optimize your component.
Hooks should be as “static” as possible. This means you shouldn’t dynamically mutate them. For example, this means you shouldn’t write higher order Hooks:
Hooks should be immutable and not be mutated. Instead of mutating a Hook dynamically, create a static version of the Hook with the desired functionality.
Hooks should also not be dynamically used: for example, instead of doing dependency injection in a component by passing a Hook as a value:
You should always inline the call of the Hook into that component and handle any logic in there.
This way, <Button /> is much easier to understand and debug. When Hooks are used in dynamic ways, it increases the complexity of your app greatly and inhibits local reasoning, making your team less productive in the long term. It also makes it easier to accidentally break the Rules of Hooks that Hooks should not be called conditionally. If you find yourself needing to mock components for tests, it’s better to mock the server instead to respond with canned data. If possible, it’s also usually more effective to test your app with end-to-end tests.

# Rules of Hooks


# Only call Hooks at the top level


# Note


# Only call Hooks from React functions

Hooks are defined using JavaScript functions, but they represent a special type of reusable UI logic with restrictions on where they can be called.
Only call Hooks at the top level
Only call Hooks from React functions
Functions whose names start with use are called Hooks in React.
Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, nested functions, or try/catch/finally blocks. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns. You can only call Hooks while React is rendering a function component:
✅ Call them at the top level in the body of a function component.
✅ Call them at the top level in the body of a custom Hook.
It’s not supported to call Hooks (functions starting with use) in any other cases, for example:
🔴 Do not call Hooks inside conditions or loops.
🔴 Do not call Hooks after a conditional return statement.
🔴 Do not call Hooks in event handlers.
🔴 Do not call Hooks in class components.
🔴 Do not call Hooks inside functions passed to useMemo, useReducer, or useEffect.
🔴 Do not call Hooks inside try/catch/finally blocks.
If you break these rules, you might see this error.
You can use the eslint-plugin-react-hooks plugin to catch these mistakes.
Custom Hooks may call other Hooks (that’s their whole purpose). This works because custom Hooks are also supposed to only be called while a function component is rendering.
Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Instead, you can:
✅ Call Hooks from React function components.
✅ Call Hooks from custom Hooks.
By following this rule, you ensure that all stateful logic in a component is clearly visible from its source code.

```
function Counter() {
  // ✅ Good: top-level in a function component
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  // ...
}

function useWindowWidth() {
  // ✅ Good: top-level in a custom Hook
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);
  // ...
}
```


```
function Bad({ cond }) {
  if (cond) {
    // 🔴 Bad: inside a condition (to fix, move it outside!)

# Async components with Server Components

Server Components are a new type of Component that renders ahead of time, before bundling, in an environment separate from your client app or SSR server.
This separate environment is the “server” in React Server Components. Server Components can run once at build time on your CI server, or they can be run for each request using a web server.
Server Components without a Server
Server Components with a Server
Adding interactivity to Server Components
Async components with Server Components
While React Server Components in React 19 are stable and will not break between major versions, the underlying APIs used to implement a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x.
To support React Server Components as a bundler or framework, we recommend pinning to a specific React version, or using the Canary release. We will continue working with bundlers and frameworks to stabilize the APIs used to implement React Server Components in the future.
Server components can run at build time to read from the filesystem or fetch static content, so a web server is not required. For example, you may want to read static data from a content management system.
Without Server Components, it’s common to fetch static data on the client with an Effect:
This pattern means users need to download and parse an additional 75K (gzipped) of libraries, and wait for a second request to fetch the data after the page loads, just to render static content that will not change for the lifetime of the page.
With Server Components, you can render these components once at build time:
The rendered output can then be server-side rendered (SSR) to HTML and uploaded to a CDN. When the app loads, the client will not see the original Page component, or the expensive libraries for rendering the markdown. The client will only see the rendered output:
This means the content is visible during first page load, and the bundle does not include the expensive libraries needed to render the static content.
You may notice that the Server Component above is an async function:
Async Components are a new feature of Server Components that allow you to await in render.
See Async components with Server Components below.
Server Components can also run on a web server during a request for a page, letting you access your data layer without having to build an API. They are rendered before your application is bundled, and can pass data and JSX as props to Client Components.
Without Server Components, it’s common to fetch dynamic data on the client in an Effect:
With Server Components, you can read the data and render it in the component:
The bundler then combines the data, rendered Server Components and dynamic Client Components into a bundle. Optionally, that bundle can then be server-side rendered (SSR) to create the initial HTML for the page. When the page loads, the browser does not see the original Note and Author components; only the rendered output is sent to the client:
Server Components can be made dynamic by re-fetching them from a server, where they can access the data and render again. This new application architecture combines the simple “request/response” mental model of server-centric Multi-Page Apps with the seamless interactivity of client-centric Single-Page Apps, giving you the best of both worlds.
Server Components are not sent to the browser, so they cannot use interactive APIs like useState. To add interactivity to Server Components, you can compose them with Client Component using the ""use client"" directive.
A common misunderstanding is that Server Components are denoted by ""use server"", but there is no directive for Server Components. The ""use server"" directive is used for Server Actions.
For more info, see the docs for Directives.
In the following example, the Notes Server Component imports an Expandable Client Component that uses state to toggle its expanded state:
This works by first rendering Notes as a Server Component, and then instructing the bundler to create a bundle for the Client Component Expandable. In the browser, the Client Components will see output of the Server Components passed as props:
Server Components introduce a new way to write Components using async/await. When you await in an async component, React will suspend and wait for the promise to resolve before resuming rendering. This works across server/client boundaries with streaming support for Suspense.
You can even create a promise on the server, and await it on the client:
The note content is important data for the page to render, so we await it on the server. The comments are below the fold and lower-priority, so we start the promise on the server, and wait for it on the client with the use API. This will Suspend on the client, without blocking the note content from rendering.
Since async components are not supported on the client, we await the promise with use.

Creating a Server Action from a Server Component
Importing Server Actions from Client Components
Composing Server Actions with Actions
Form Actions with Server Actions
Server Actions with useActionState
Progressive enhancement with useActionState
While Server Actions in React 19 are stable and will not break between major versions, the underlying APIs used to implement Server Actions in a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x.
To support Server Actions as a bundler or framework, we recommend pinning to a specific React version, or using the Canary release. We will continue working with bundlers and frameworks to stabilize the APIs used to implement Server Actions in the future.
When a Server Action is defined with the ""use server"" directive, your framework will automatically create a reference to the server function, and pass that reference to the Client Component. When that function is called on the client, React will send a request to the server to execute the function, and return the result.
Server Actions can be created in Server Components and passed as props to Client Components, or they can be imported and used in Client Components.
Server Components can define Server Actions with the ""use server"" directive:
When React renders the EmptyNote Server Component, it will create a reference to the createNoteAction function, and pass that reference to the Button Client Component. When the button is clicked, React will send a request to the server to execute the createNoteAction function with the reference provided:
For more, see the docs for ""use server"".
Client Components can import Server Actions from files that use the ""use server"" directive:
When the bundler builds the EmptyNote Client Component, it will create a reference to the createNoteAction function in the bundle. When the button is clicked, React will send a request to the server to execute the createNoteAction function using the reference provided:
For more, see the docs for ""use server"".
Server Actions can be composed with Actions on the client:
This allows you to access the isPending state of the Server Action by wrapping it in an Action on the client.
For more, see the docs for Calling a Server Action outside of <form>
Server Actions work with the new Form features in React 19.
You can pass a Server Action to a Form to automatically submit the form to the server:
When the Form submission succeeds, React will automatically reset the form. You can add useActionState to access the pending state, last response, or to support progressive enhancement.
For more, see the docs for Server Actions in Forms.
You can compose Server Actions with useActionState for the common case where you just need access to the action pending state and last returned response:
When using useActionState with Server Actions, React will also automatically replay form submissions entered before hydration finishes. This means users can interact with your app even before the app has hydrated.
For more, see the docs for useActionState.
Server Actions also support progressive enhancement with the third argument of useActionState.
When the permalink is provided to useActionState, React will redirect to the provided URL if the form is submitted before the JavaScript bundle loads.
For more, see the docs for useActionState.

When a file marked with 'use client' is imported from a Server Component, compatible bundlers will treat the module import as a boundary between server-run and client-run code.
As dependencies of RichTextEditor, formatDate and Button will also be evaluated on the client regardless of whether their modules contain a 'use client' directive. Note that a single module may be evaluated on the server when imported from server code and on the client when imported from client code.
'use client' must be at the very beginning of a file, above any imports or other code (comments are OK). They must be written with single or double quotes, but not backticks.
When a 'use client' module is imported from another client-rendered module, the directive has no effect.
When a component module contains a 'use client' directive, any usage of that component is guaranteed to be a Client Component. However, a component can still be evaluated on the client even if it does not have a 'use client' directive.
A component usage is considered a Client Component if it is defined in module with 'use client' directive or when it is a transitive dependency of a module that contains a 'use client' directive. Otherwise, it is a Server Component.
A component usage is considered a Client Component if it is defined in module with 'use client' directive or when it is a transitive dependency of a module that contains a 'use client' directive. Otherwise, it is a Server Component.
Code that is marked for client evaluation is not limited to components. All code that is a part of the Client module sub-tree is sent to and run by the client.
When a server evaluated module imports values from a 'use client' module, the values must either be a React component or supported serializable prop values to be passed to a Client Component. Any other use case will throw an exception.
In a React app, components are often split into separate files, or modules.
For apps that use React Server Components, the app is server-rendered by default. 'use client' introduces a server-client boundary in the module dependency tree, effectively creating a subtree of Client modules.
To better illustrate this, consider the following React Server Components app.
In the module dependency tree of this example app, the 'use client' directive in InspirationGenerator.js marks that module and all of its transitive dependencies as Client modules. The subtree starting at InspirationGenerator.js is now marked as Client modules.
'use client' segments the module dependency tree of the React Server Components app, marking InspirationGenerator.js and all of its dependencies as client-rendered.
During render, the framework will server-render the root component and continue through the render tree, opting-out of evaluating any code imported from client-marked code.
The server-rendered portion of the render tree is then sent to the client. The client, with its client code downloaded, then completes rendering the rest of the tree.
The render tree for the React Server Components app. InspirationGenerator and its child component FancyText are components exported from client-marked code and considered Client Components.
We introduce the following definitions:
Client Components are components in a render tree that are rendered on the client.
Server Components are components in a render tree that are rendered on the server.
Working through the example app, App, FancyText and Copyright are all server-rendered and considered Server Components. As InspirationGenerator.js and its transitive dependencies are marked as client code, the component InspirationGenerator and its child component FancyText are Client Components.

















With 'use client', you can determine when components are Client Components. As Server Components are default, here is a brief overview of the advantages and limitations to Server Components to determine when you need to mark something as client rendered.
For simplicity, we talk about Server Components, but the same principles apply to all code in your app that is server run.
Server Components can reduce the amount of code sent and run by the client. Only Client modules are bundled and evaluated by the client.
Server Components benefit from running on the server. They can access the local filesystem and may experience low latency for data fetches and network requests.
Server Components cannot support interaction as event handlers must be registered and triggered by a client.
For example, event handlers like onClick can only be defined in Client Components.
For example, event handlers like onClick can only be defined in Client Components.
Server Components cannot use most Hooks.
When Server Components are rendered, their output is essentially a list of components for the client to render. Server Components do not persist in memory after render and cannot have their own state.
When Server Components are rendered, their output is essentially a list of components for the client to render. Server Components do not persist in memory after render and cannot have their own state.
As in any React app, parent components pass data to child components. As they are rendered in different environments, passing data from a Server Component to a Client Component requires extra consideration.
Prop values passed from a Server Component to Client Component must be serializable.
Serializable props include:
Primitives
string
number
bigint
boolean
undefined
null
symbol, only symbols registered in the global Symbol registry via Symbol.for

Plain objects: those created with object initializers, with serializable properties
Functions that are Server Actions
Client or Server Component elements (JSX)
Promises
Notably, these are not supported:
Functions that are not exported from client-marked modules or marked with 'use server'
Classes
Objects that are instances of any class (other than the built-ins mentioned) or objects with a null prototype
Symbols not registered globally, ex. Symbol('my new symbol')
As Counter requires both the useState Hook and event handlers to increment or decrement the value, this component must be a Client Component and will require a 'use client' directive at the top.
In contrast, a component that renders UI without interaction will not need to be a Client Component.
For example, Counter’s parent component, CounterContainer, does not require 'use client' as it is not interactive and does not use state. In addition, CounterContainer must be a Server Component as it reads from the local file system on the server, which is possible only in a Server Component.
There are also components that don’t use any server or client-only features and can be agnostic to where they render. In our earlier example, FancyText is one such component.
In this case, we don’t add the 'use client' directive, resulting in FancyText’s output (rather than its source code) to be sent to the browser when referenced from a Server Component. As demonstrated in the earlier Inspirations app example, FancyText is used as both a Server or Client Component, depending on where it is imported and used.
But if FancyText’s HTML output was large relative to its source code (including dependencies), it might be more efficient to force it to always be a Client Component. Components that return a long SVG path string are one case where it may be more efficient to force a component to be a Client Component.
Your React app may use client-specific APIs, such as the browser’s APIs for web storage, audio and video manipulation, and device hardware, among others.
In this example, the component uses DOM APIs to manipulate a canvas element. Since those APIs are only available in the browser, it must be marked as a Client Component.
Often in a React app, you’ll leverage third-party libraries to handle common UI patterns or logic.
These libraries may rely on component Hooks or client APIs. Third-party components that use any of the following React APIs must run on the client:
createContext
react and react-dom Hooks, excluding use and useId
forwardRef
memo
startTransition
If they use client APIs, ex. DOM insertion or native platform views
If these libraries have been updated to be compatible with React Server Components, then they will already include 'use client' markers of their own, allowing you to use them directly from your Server Components. If a library hasn’t been updated, or if a component needs props like event handlers that can only be specified on the client, you may need to add your own Client Component file in between the third-party Client Component and your Server Component where you’d like to use it.

```
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';
import { formatDate } from './formatters';
import Button from './button';

export default function RichTextEditor({ timestamp, text }) {
  const date = formatDate(timestamp);
  // ...
  const editButton = <Button />;
  // ...
}
```


```

```


```

```


```
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises';
import Counter from './Counter';

export default async function CounterContainer() {
  const initialValue = await readFile('/path/to/counter_value');
  return <Counter initialValue={initialValue} />
}
```


```
export default function FancyText({title, text}) {
  return title
    ? <h1 className='fancy title'>{text}</h1>
    : <h3 className='fancy cursive'>{text}</h3>
}
```


```

    context.arc(100, 75, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
    context.stroke();
  });

Calling a Server Action outside of <form>
Server Actions in forms
Calling a Server Action outside of <form>
Add 'use server' at the top of an async function body to mark the function as callable by the client. We call these functions Server Actions.
When calling a Server Action on the client, it will make a network request to the server that includes a serialized copy of any arguments passed. If the Server Action returns a value, that value will be serialized and returned to the client.
Instead of individually marking functions with 'use server', you can add the directive to the top of a file to mark all exports within that file as Server Actions that can be used anywhere, including imported in client code.
'use server' must be at the very beginning of their function or module; above any other code including imports (comments above directives are OK). They must be written with single or double quotes, not backticks.
'use server' can only be used in server-side files. The resulting Server Actions can be passed to Client Components through props. See supported types for serialization.
To import a Server Action from client code, the directive must be used on a module level.
Because the underlying network calls are always asynchronous, 'use server' can only be used on async functions.
Always treat arguments to Server Actions as untrusted input and authorize any mutations. See security considerations.
Server Actions should be called in a Transition. Server Actions passed to <form action> or formAction will automatically be called in a transition.
Server Actions are designed for mutations that update server-side state; they are not recommended for data fetching. Accordingly, frameworks implementing Server Actions typically process one action at a time and do not have a way to cache the return value.
Arguments to Server Actions are fully client-controlled. For security, always treat them as untrusted input, and make sure to validate and escape arguments as appropriate.
In any Server Action, make sure to validate that the logged-in user is allowed to perform that action.
To prevent sending sensitive data from a Server Action, there are experimental taint APIs to prevent unique values and objects from being passed to client code.
See experimental_taintUniqueValue and experimental_taintObjectReference.
As client code calls the Server Action over the network, any arguments passed will need to be serializable.
Here are supported types for Server Action arguments:
Primitives
string
number
bigint
boolean
undefined
null
symbol, only symbols registered in the global Symbol registry via Symbol.for

Classes
Objects that are instances of any class (other than the built-ins mentioned) or objects with a null prototype
Symbols not registered globally, ex. Symbol('my new symbol')
Supported serializable return values are the same as serializable props for a boundary Client Component.
The most common use case of Server Actions will be calling server functions that mutate data. On the browser, the HTML form element is the traditional approach for a user to submit a mutation. With React Server Components, React introduces first-class support for Server Actions in forms.
Here is a form that allows a user to request a username.
In this example requestUsername is a Server Action passed to a <form>. When a user submits this form, there is a network request to the server function requestUsername. When calling a Server Action in a form, React will supply the form’s FormData as the first argument to the Server Action.
By passing a Server Action to the form action, React can progressively enhance the form. This means that forms can be submitted before the JavaScript bundle is loaded.
In the username request form, there might be the chance that a username is not available. requestUsername should tell us if it fails or not.
To update the UI based on the result of a Server Action while supporting progressive enhancement, use useActionState.
Note that like most Hooks, useActionState can only be called in client code.
Server Actions are exposed server endpoints and can be called anywhere in client code.
When using a Server Action outside of a form, call the Server Action in a Transition, which allows you to display a loading indicator, show optimistic state updates, and handle unexpected errors. Forms will automatically wrap Server Actions in transitions.
To read a Server Action return value, you’ll need to await the promise returned.

Call Children.count(children) to count the number of children in the children data structure.
See more examples below.
children: The value of the children prop received by your component.
The number of nodes inside these children.
Empty nodes (null, undefined, and Booleans), strings, numbers, and React elements count as individual nodes. Arrays don’t count as individual nodes, but their children do. The traversal does not go deeper than React elements: they don’t get rendered, and their children aren’t traversed. Fragments don’t get traversed.
Call Children.forEach(children, fn, thisArg?) to run some code for each child in the children data structure.
See more examples below.
children: The value of the children prop received by your component.
fn: The function you want to run for each child, similar to the array forEach method callback. It will be called with the child as the first argument and its index as the second argument. The index starts at 0 and increments on each call.
optional thisArg: The this value with which the fn function should be called. If omitted, it’s undefined.
Children.forEach returns undefined.
Empty nodes (null, undefined, and Booleans), strings, numbers, and React elements count as individual nodes. Arrays don’t count as individual nodes, but their children do. The traversal does not go deeper than React elements: they don’t get rendered, and their children aren’t traversed. Fragments don’t get traversed.
Call Children.map(children, fn, thisArg?) to map or transform each child in the children data structure.
See more examples below.
children: The value of the children prop received by your component.
fn: The mapping function, similar to the array map method callback. It will be called with the child as the first argument and its index as the second argument. The index starts at 0 and increments on each call. You need to return a React node from this function. This may be an empty node (null, undefined, or a Boolean), a string, a number, a React element, or an array of other React nodes.
optional thisArg: The this value with which the fn function should be called. If omitted, it’s undefined.
If children is null or undefined, returns the same value.
Otherwise, returns a flat array consisting of the nodes you’ve returned from the fn function. The returned array will contain all nodes you returned except for null and undefined.
Empty nodes (null, undefined, and Booleans), strings, numbers, and React elements count as individual nodes. Arrays don’t count as individual nodes, but their children do. The traversal does not go deeper than React elements: they don’t get rendered, and their children aren’t traversed. Fragments don’t get traversed.

The traversal does not go deeper than React elements: they don’t get rendered, and their children aren’t traversed. Fragments don’t get traversed.
If you return an element or an array of elements with keys from fn, the returned elements’ keys will be automatically combined with the key of the corresponding original item from children. When you return multiple elements from fn in an array, their keys only need to be unique locally amongst each other.
If you return an element or an array of elements with keys from fn, the returned elements’ keys will be automatically combined with the key of the corresponding original item from children. When you return multiple elements from fn in an array, their keys only need to be unique locally amongst each other.
Call Children.only(children) to assert that children represent a single React element.
children: The value of the children prop received by your component.
If children is a valid element, returns that element.
Otherwise, throws an error.
This method always throws if you pass an array (such as the return value of Children.map) as children. In other words, it enforces that children is a single React element, not that it’s an array with a single element.
Call Children.toArray(children) to create an array out of the children data structure.
children: The value of the children prop received by your component.
Returns a flat array of elements in children.
Empty nodes (null, undefined, and Booleans) will be omitted in the returned array. The returned elements’ keys will be calculated from the original elements’ keys and their level of nesting and position. This ensures that flattening the array does not introduce changes in behavior.
To transform the children JSX that your component receives as the children prop, call Children.map:
In the example above, the RowList wraps every child it receives into a <div className=""Row""> container. For example, let’s say the parent component passes three <p> tags as the children prop to RowList:
Then, with the RowList implementation above, the final rendered result will look like this:
Children.map is similar to to transforming arrays with map(). The difference is that the children data structure is considered opaque. This means that even if it’s sometimes an array, you should not assume it’s an array or any other particular data type. This is why you should use Children.map if you need to transform it.



The children data structure does not include rendered output of the components you pass as JSX. In the example below, the children received by the RowList only contains two items rather than three:
<p>This is the first item.</p>
<MoreRows />
This is why only two row wrappers are generated in this example:
There is no way to get the rendered output of an inner component like <MoreRows /> when manipulating children. This is why it’s usually better to use one of the alternative solutions.
Call Children.forEach to iterate over each child in the children data structure. It does not return any value and is similar to the array forEach method. You can use it to run custom logic like constructing your own array.
As mentioned earlier, there is no way to get the rendered output of an inner component when manipulating children. This is why it’s usually better to use one of the alternative solutions.
Call Children.count(children) to calculate the number of children.
As mentioned earlier, there is no way to get the rendered output of an inner component when manipulating children. This is why it’s usually better to use one of the alternative solutions.
Call Children.toArray(children) to turn the children data structure into a regular JavaScript array. This lets you manipulate the array with built-in array methods like filter, sort, or reverse.
As mentioned earlier, there is no way to get the rendered output of an inner component when manipulating children. This is why it’s usually better to use one of the alternative solutions.
This section describes alternatives to the Children API (with capital C) that’s imported like this:
Don’t confuse it with using the children prop (lowercase c), which is good and encouraged.
Manipulating children with the Children methods often leads to fragile code. When you pass children to a component in JSX, you don’t usually expect the component to manipulate or transform the individual children.
When you can, try to avoid using the Children methods. For example, if you want every child of RowList to be wrapped in <div className=""Row"">, export a Row component, and manually wrap every row into it like this:
Unlike using Children.map, this approach does not wrap every child automatically. However, this approach has a significant benefit compared to the earlier example with Children.map because it works even if you keep extracting more components. For example, it still works if you extract your own MoreRows component:
This wouldn’t work with Children.map because it would “see” <MoreRows /> as a single child (and a single row).
You can also explicitly pass an array as a prop. For example, this RowList accepts a rows array as a prop:
Since rows is a regular JavaScript array, the RowList component can use built-in array methods like map on it.
This pattern is especially useful when you want to be able to pass more information as structured data together with children. In the below example, the TabSwitcher component receives an array of objects as the tabs prop:
Unlike passing the children as JSX, this approach lets you associate some extra data like header with each item. Because you are working with the tabs directly, and it is an array, you do not need the Children methods.
Instead of producing JSX for every single item, you can also pass a function that returns JSX, and call that function when necessary. In this example, the App component passes a renderContent function to the TabSwitcher component. The TabSwitcher component calls renderContent only for the selected tab:
A prop like renderContent is called a render prop because it is a prop that specifies how to render a piece of the user interface. However, there is nothing special about it: it is a regular prop which happens to be a function.
Render props are functions, so you can pass information to them. For example, this RowList component passes the id and the index of each row to the renderRow render prop, which uses index to highlight even rows:
This is another example of how parent and child components can cooperate without manipulating the children.
Suppose you pass two children to RowList like this:
If you do Children.count(children) inside RowList, you will get 2. Even if MoreRows renders 10 different items, or if it returns null, Children.count(children) will still be 2. From the RowList’s perspective, it only “sees” the JSX it has received. It does not “see” the internals of the MoreRows component.
The limitation makes it hard to extract a component. This is why alternatives are preferred to using Children.

```
const mappedChildren = Children.map(children, child =>
  <div className=""Row"">
    {child}
  </div>
);

import { Children } from 'react';

Using cloneElement is uncommon and can lead to fragile code. See common alternatives.
cloneElement lets you create a new React element using another element as a starting point.

Call cloneElement to create a React element based on the element, but with different props and children:
See more examples below.
element: The element argument must be a valid React element. For example, it could be a JSX node like <Something />, the result of calling createElement, or the result of another cloneElement call.
element: The element argument must be a valid React element. For example, it could be a JSX node like <Something />, the result of calling createElement, or the result of another cloneElement call.
props: The props argument must either be an object or null. If you pass null, the cloned element will retain all of the original element.props. Otherwise, for every prop in the props object, the returned element will “prefer” the value from props over the value from element.props. The rest of the props will be filled from the original element.props. If you pass props.key or props.ref, they will replace the original ones.

optional ...children: Zero or more child nodes. They can be any React nodes, including React elements, strings, numbers, portals, empty nodes (null, undefined, true, and false), and arrays of React nodes. If you don’t pass any ...children arguments, the original element.props.children will be preserved.

If you don’t pass any ...children arguments, the original element.props.children will be preserved.
cloneElement returns a React element object with a few properties:
type: Same as element.type.
props: The result of shallowly merging element.props with the overriding props you have passed.
ref: The original element.ref, unless it was overridden by props.ref.
key: The original element.key, unless it was overridden by props.key.
Usually, you’ll return the element from your component or make it a child of another element. Although you may read the element’s properties, it’s best to treat every element as opaque after it’s created, and only render it.
Cloning an element does not modify the original element.

You should only pass children as multiple arguments to cloneElement if they are all statically known, like cloneElement(element, null, child1, child2, child3). If your children are dynamic, pass the entire array as the third argument: cloneElement(element, null, listItems). This ensures that React will warn you about missing keys for any dynamic lists. For static lists this is not necessary because they never reorder.

To override the props of some React element, pass it to cloneElement with the props you want to override:
Here, the resulting cloned element will be <Row title=""Cabbage"" isHighlighted={true} />.
Let’s walk through an example to see when it’s useful.
Imagine a List component that renders its children as a list of selectable rows with a “Next” button that changes which row is selected. The List component needs to render the selected Row differently, so it clones every <Row> child that it has received, and adds an extra isHighlighted: true or isHighlighted: false prop:
Let’s say the original JSX received by List looks like this:
By cloning its children, the List can pass extra information to every Row inside. The result looks like this:
Notice how pressing “Next” updates the state of the List, and highlights a different row:
To summarize, the List cloned the <Row /> elements it received and added an extra prop to them.
Cloning children makes it hard to tell how the data flows through your app. Try one of the alternatives.
Instead of using cloneElement, consider accepting a render prop like renderItem. Here, List receives renderItem as a prop. List calls renderItem for every item and passes isHighlighted as an argument:
The renderItem prop is called a “render prop” because it’s a prop that specifies how to render something. For example, you can pass a renderItem implementation that renders a <Row> with the given isHighlighted value:
The end result is the same as with cloneElement:
However, you can clearly trace where the isHighlighted value is coming from.
This pattern is preferred to cloneElement because it is more explicit.
Another alternative to cloneElement is to pass data through context.
For example, you can call createContext to define a HighlightContext:
Your List component can wrap every item it renders into a HighlightContext provider:
With this approach, Row does not need to receive an isHighlighted prop at all. Instead, it reads the context:
This allows the calling component to not know or worry about passing isHighlighted to <Row>:
Instead, List and Row coordinate the highlighting logic through context.
Learn more about passing data through context.
Another approach you can try is to extract the “non-visual” logic into your own Hook, and use the information returned by your Hook to decide what to render. For example, you could write a useList custom Hook like this:
Then you could use it like this:
The data flow is explicit, but the state is inside the useList custom Hook that you can use from any component:
This approach is particularly useful if you want to reuse this logic between different components.

We recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. See how to migrate.
Component is the base class for the React components defined as JavaScript classes. Class components are still supported by React, but we don’t recommend using them in new code.

To define a React component as a class, extend the built-in Component class and define a render method:
Only the render method is required, other methods are optional.
See more examples below.
The context of a class component is available as this.context. It is only available if you specify which context you want to receive using static contextType (modern) or static contextTypes (deprecated).
A class component can only read one context at a time.
Reading this.context in class components is equivalent to useContext in function components.
See how to migrate.
The props passed to a class component are available as this.props.
Reading this.props in class components is equivalent to declaring props in function components.
See how to migrate.
This API will be removed in a future major version of React. Use createRef instead.
Lets you access legacy string refs for this component.
The state of a class component is available as this.state. The state field must be an object. Do not mutate the state directly. If you wish to change the state, call setState with the new state.
Defining state in class components is equivalent to calling useState in function components.
See how to migrate.
The constructor runs before your class component mounts (gets added to the screen). Typically, a constructor is only used for two purposes in React. It lets you declare state and bind your class methods to the class instance:
If you use modern JavaScript syntax, constructors are rarely needed. Instead, you can rewrite this code above using the public class field syntax which is supported both by modern browsers and tools like Babel:
A constructor should not contain any side effects or subscriptions.
props: The component’s initial props.
constructor should not return anything.
Do not run any side effects or subscriptions in the constructor. Instead, use componentDidMount for that.

Inside a constructor, you need to call super(props) before any other statement. If you don’t do that, this.props will be undefined while the constructor runs, which can be confusing and cause bugs.

When Strict Mode is on, React will call constructor twice in development and then throw away one of the instances. This helps you notice the accidental side effects that need to be moved out of the constructor.

There is no exact equivalent for constructor in function components. To declare state in a function component, call useState. To avoid recalculating the initial state, pass a function to useState.
If you define componentDidCatch, React will call it when some child component (including distant children) throws an error during rendering. This lets you log that error to an error reporting service in production.
Typically, it is used together with static getDerivedStateFromError which lets you update state in response to an error and display an error message to the user. A component with these methods is called an error boundary.
See an example.
error: The error that was thrown. In practice, it will usually be an instance of Error but this is not guaranteed because JavaScript allows to throw any value, including strings or even null.
error: The error that was thrown. In practice, it will usually be an instance of Error but this is not guaranteed because JavaScript allows to throw any value, including strings or even null.
info: An object containing additional information about the error. Its componentStack field contains a stack trace with the component that threw, as well as the names and source locations of all its parent components. In production, the component names will be minified. If you set up production error reporting, you can decode the component stack using sourcemaps the same way as you would do for regular JavaScript error stacks.

In production, the component names will be minified. If you set up production error reporting, you can decode the component stack using sourcemaps the same way as you would do for regular JavaScript error stacks.
componentDidCatch should not return anything.
In the past, it was common to call setState inside componentDidCatch in order to update the UI and display the fallback error message. This is deprecated in favor of defining static getDerivedStateFromError.

Production and development builds of React slightly differ in the way componentDidCatch handles errors. In development, the errors will bubble up to window, which means that any window.onerror or window.addEventListener('error', callback) will intercept the errors that have been caught by componentDidCatch. In production, instead, the errors will not bubble up, which means any ancestor error handler will only receive errors not explicitly caught by componentDidCatch.

There is no direct equivalent for componentDidCatch in function components yet. If you’d like to avoid creating class components, write a single ErrorBoundary component like above and use it throughout your app. Alternatively, you can use the react-error-boundary package which does that for you.
If you define the componentDidMount method, React will call it when your component is added (mounted) to the screen. This is a common place to start data fetching, set up subscriptions, or manipulate the DOM nodes.
If you implement componentDidMount, you usually need to implement other lifecycle methods to avoid bugs. For example, if componentDidMount reads some state or props, you also have to implement componentDidUpdate to handle their changes, and componentWillUnmount to clean up whatever componentDidMount was doing.
See more examples.
componentDidMount does not take any parameters.
componentDidMount should not return anything.
When Strict Mode is on, in development React will call componentDidMount, then immediately call componentWillUnmount, and then call componentDidMount again. This helps you notice if you forgot to implement componentWillUnmount or if its logic doesn’t fully “mirror” what componentDidMount does.

Although you may call setState immediately in componentDidMount, it’s best to avoid that when you can. It will trigger an extra rendering, but it will happen before the browser updates the screen. This guarantees that even though the render will be called twice in this case, the user won’t see the intermediate state. Use this pattern with caution because it often causes performance issues. In most cases, you should be able to assign the initial state in the constructor instead. It can, however, be necessary for cases like modals and tooltips when you need to measure a DOM node before rendering something that depends on its size or position.

For many use cases, defining componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount together in class components is equivalent to calling useEffect in function components. In the rare cases where it’s important for the code to run before browser paint, useLayoutEffect is a closer match.
See how to migrate.
If you define the componentDidUpdate method, React will call it immediately after your component has been re-rendered with updated props or state.  This method is not called for the initial render.
You can use it to manipulate the DOM after an update. This is also a common place to do network requests as long as you compare the current props to previous props (e.g. a network request may not be necessary if the props have not changed). Typically, you’d use it together with componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount:
See more examples.
prevProps: Props before the update. Compare prevProps to this.props to determine what changed.

prevState: State before the update. Compare prevState to this.state to determine what changed.

If you define the componentWillUnmount method, React will call it before your component is removed (unmounted) from the screen. This is a common place to cancel data fetching or remove subscriptions.
The logic inside componentWillUnmount should “mirror” the logic inside componentDidMount. For example, if componentDidMount sets up a subscription, componentWillUnmount should clean up that subscription. If the cleanup logic in your componentWillUnmount reads some props or state, you will usually also need to implement componentDidUpdate to clean up resources (such as subscriptions) corresponding to the old props and state.

Forces a component to re-render.
Usually, this is not necessary. If your component’s render method only reads from this.props, this.state, or this.context, it will re-render automatically when you call setState inside your component or one of its parents. However, if your component’s render method reads directly from an external data source, you have to tell React to update the user interface when that data source changes. That’s what forceUpdate lets you do.
Try to avoid all uses of forceUpdate and only read from this.props and this.state in render.
optional callback If specified, React will call the callback you’ve provided after the update is committed.
forceUpdate does not return anything.
If you call forceUpdate, React will re-render without calling shouldComponentUpdate.
Reading an external data source and forcing class components to re-render in response to its changes with forceUpdate has been superseded by useSyncExternalStore in function components.
This API will be removed in a future major version of React. Use Context.Provider instead.
Lets you specify the values for the legacy context is provided by this component.
If you implement getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, React will call it immediately before React updates the DOM. It enables your component to capture some information from the DOM (e.g. scroll position) before it is potentially changed. Any value returned by this lifecycle method will be passed as a parameter to componentDidUpdate.
For example, you can use it in a UI like a chat thread that needs to preserve its scroll position during updates:
In the above example, it is important to read the scrollHeight property directly in getSnapshotBeforeUpdate. It is not safe to read it in render, UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps, or UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate because there is a potential time gap between these methods getting called and React updating the DOM.
prevProps: Props before the update. Compare prevProps to this.props to determine what changed.
prevProps: Props before the update. Compare prevProps to this.props to determine what changed.
prevState: State before the update. Compare prevState to this.state to determine what changed.
prevState: State before the update. Compare prevState to this.state to determine what changed.
You should return a snapshot value of any type that you’d like, or null. The value you returned will be passed as the third argument to componentDidUpdate.
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate will not get called if shouldComponentUpdate is defined and returns false.
At the moment, there is no equivalent to getSnapshotBeforeUpdate for function components. This use case is very uncommon, but if you have the need for it, for now you’ll have to write a class component.
The render method is the only required method in a class component.
The render method should specify what you want to appear on the screen, for example:
React may call render at any moment, so you shouldn’t assume that it runs at a particular time. Usually, the render method should return a piece of JSX, but a few other return types (like strings) are supported. To calculate the returned JSX, the render method can read this.props, this.state, and this.context.
You should write the render method as a pure function, meaning that it should return the same result if props, state, and context are the same. It also shouldn’t contain side effects (like setting up subscriptions) or interact with the browser APIs. Side effects should happen either in event handlers or methods like componentDidMount.
render does not take any parameters.
render can return any valid React node. This includes React elements such as <div />, strings, numbers, portals, empty nodes (null, undefined, true, and false), and arrays of React nodes.
render should be written as a pure function of props, state, and context. It should not have side effects.

render will not get called if shouldComponentUpdate is defined and returns false.
When Strict Mode is on, React will call render twice in development and then throw away one of the results. This helps you notice the accidental side effects that need to be moved out of the render method.

There is no one-to-one correspondence between the render call and the subsequent componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate call. Some of the render call results may be discarded by React when it’s beneficial.

Call setState to update the state of your React component.
setState enqueues changes to the component state. It tells React that this component and its children need to re-render with the new state. This is the main way you’ll update the user interface in response to interactions.
Calling setState does not change the current state in the already executing code:
It only affects what this.state will return starting from the next render.
You can also pass a function to setState. It lets you update state based on the previous state:
You don’t have to do this, but it’s handy if you want to update state multiple times during the same event.
nextState: Either an object or a function.
If you pass an object as nextState, it will be shallowly merged into this.state.
If you pass a function as nextState, it will be treated as an updater function. It must be pure, should take the pending state and props as arguments, and should return the object to be shallowly merged into this.state. React will put your updater function in a queue and re-render your component. During the next render, React will calculate the next state by applying all of the queued updaters to the previous state.

optional callback: If specified, React will call the callback you’ve provided after the update is committed.

setState does not return anything.
Think of setState as a request rather than an immediate command to update the component. When multiple components update their state in response to an event, React will batch their updates and re-render them together in a single pass at the end of the event. In the rare case that you need to force a particular state update to be applied synchronously, you may wrap it in flushSync, but this may hurt performance.

In the rare case that you need to force a particular state update to be applied synchronously, you may wrap it in flushSync, but this may hurt performance.
setState does not update this.state immediately. This makes reading this.state right after calling setState a potential pitfall. Instead, use componentDidUpdate or the setState callback argument, either of which are guaranteed to fire after the update has been applied. If you need to set the state based on the previous state, you can pass a function to nextState as described above.

Calling setState in class components is similar to calling a set function in function components.
See how to migrate.
If you define shouldComponentUpdate, React will call it to determine whether a re-render can be skipped.
If you are confident you want to write it by hand, you may compare this.props with nextProps and this.state with nextState and return false to tell React the update can be skipped.
React calls shouldComponentUpdate before rendering when new props or state are being received. Defaults to true. This method is not called for the initial render or when forceUpdate is used.
nextProps: The next props that the component is about to render with. Compare nextProps to this.props to determine what changed.
nextState: The next state that the component is about to render with. Compare nextState to this.state to determine what changed.
nextContext: The next context that the component is about to render with. Compare nextContext to this.context to determine what changed. Only available if you specify static contextType (modern) or static contextTypes (legacy).
Return true if you want the component to re-render. That’s the default behavior.
Return false to tell React that re-rendering can be skipped.
This method only exists as a performance optimization. If your component breaks without it, fix that first.

Consider using PureComponent instead of writing shouldComponentUpdate by hand. PureComponent shallowly compares props and state, and reduces the chance that you’ll skip a necessary update.

We do not recommend doing deep equality checks or using JSON.stringify in shouldComponentUpdate. It makes performance unpredictable and dependent on the data structure of every prop and state. In the best case, you risk introducing multi-second stalls to your application, and in the worst case you risk crashing it.

Returning false does not prevent child components from re-rendering when their state changes.
Returning false does not prevent child components from re-rendering when their state changes.
Returning false does not guarantee that the component will not re-render. React will use the return value as a hint but it may still choose to re-render your component if it makes sense to do for other reasons.

Optimizing class components with shouldComponentUpdate is similar to optimizing function components with memo. Function components also offer more granular optimization with useMemo.
If you define UNSAFE_componentWillMount, React will call it immediately after the constructor. It only exists for historical reasons and should not be used in any new code. Instead, use one of the alternatives:
To initialize state, declare state as a class field or set this.state inside the constructor.
If you need to run a side effect or set up a subscription, move that logic to componentDidMount instead.
See examples of migrating away from unsafe lifecycles.

Despite its naming, UNSAFE_componentWillMount does not guarantee that the component will get mounted if your app uses modern React features like Suspense. If a render attempt is suspended (for example, because the code for some child component has not loaded yet), React will throw the in-progress tree away and attempt to construct the component from scratch during the next attempt. This is why this method is “unsafe”. Code that relies on mounting (like adding a subscription) should go into componentDidMount.

If you need to “reset” some state when a prop changes, consider either making a component fully controlled or fully uncontrolled with a key instead.
If you need to “adjust” some state when a prop changes, check whether you can compute all the necessary information from props alone during rendering. If you can’t, use static getDerivedStateFromProps instead.

Lets you specify which legacy context is consumed by this component.
If you want to read this.context from your class component, you must specify which context it needs to read. The context you specify as the static contextType must be a value previously created by createContext.
Reading this.context in class components is equivalent to useContext in function components.
See how to migrate.
You can define static defaultProps to set the default props for the class. They will be used for undefined and missing props, but not for null props.
For example, here is how you define that the color prop should default to 'blue':
If the color prop is not provided or is undefined, it will be set by default to 'blue':
Defining defaultProps in class components is similar to using default values in function components.
You can define static propTypes together with the prop-types library to declare the types of the props accepted by your component. These types will be checked during rendering and in development only.
We recommend using TypeScript instead of checking prop types at runtime.
If you define static getDerivedStateFromError, React will call it when a child component (including distant children) throws an error during rendering. This lets you display an error message instead of clearing the UI.
Typically, it is used together with componentDidCatch which lets you send the error report to some analytics service. A component with these methods is called an error boundary.
See an example.
error: The error that was thrown. In practice, it will usually be an instance of Error but this is not guaranteed because JavaScript allows to throw any value, including strings or even null.
static getDerivedStateFromError should return the state telling the component to display the error message.
static getDerivedStateFromError should be a pure function. If you want to perform a side effect (for example, to call an analytics service), you need to also implement componentDidCatch.
There is no direct equivalent for static getDerivedStateFromError in function components yet. If you’d like to avoid creating class components, write a single ErrorBoundary component like above and use it throughout your app. Alternatively, use the react-error-boundary package which does that.
If you define static getDerivedStateFromProps, React will call it right before calling render, both on the initial mount and on subsequent updates. It should return an object to update the state, or null to update nothing.
This method exists for rare use cases where the state depends on changes in props over time. For example, this Form component resets the email state when the userID prop changes:
Note that this pattern requires you to keep a previous value of the prop (like userID) in state (like prevUserID).
Deriving state leads to verbose code and makes your components difficult to think about. Make sure you’re familiar with simpler alternatives:
If you need to perform a side effect (for example, data fetching or an animation) in response to a change in props, use componentDidUpdate method instead.
If you want to re-compute some data only when a prop changes, use a memoization helper instead.
If you want to “reset” some state when a prop changes, consider either making a component fully controlled or fully uncontrolled with a key instead.
props: The next props that the component is about to render with.
state: The next state that the component is about to render with.
static getDerivedStateFromProps return an object to update the state, or null to update nothing.
This method is fired on every render, regardless of the cause. This is different from UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps, which only fires when the parent causes a re-render and not as a result of a local setState.

This method doesn’t have access to the component instance. If you’d like, you can reuse some code between static getDerivedStateFromProps and the other class methods by extracting pure functions of the component props and state outside the class definition.

Implementing static getDerivedStateFromProps in a class component is equivalent to calling the set function from useState during rendering in a function component.
To define a React component as a class, extend the built-in Component class and define a render method:
React will call your render method whenever it needs to figure out what to display on the screen. Usually, you will return some JSX from it. Your render method should be a pure function: it should only calculate the JSX.
Similarly to function components, a class component can receive information by props from its parent component. However, the syntax for reading props is different. For example, if the parent component renders <Greeting name=""Taylor"" />, then you can read the name prop from this.props, like this.props.name:
Note that Hooks (functions starting with use, like useState) are not supported inside class components.
We recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. See how to migrate.
To add state to a class, assign an object to a property called state. To update state, call this.setState.
We recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. See how to migrate.
There are a few special methods you can define on your class.
If you define the componentDidMount method, React will call it when your component is added (mounted) to the screen. React will call componentDidUpdate after your component re-renders due to changed props or state. React will call componentWillUnmount after your component has been removed (unmounted) from the screen.
If you implement componentDidMount, you usually need to implement all three lifecycles to avoid bugs. For example, if componentDidMount reads some state or props, you also have to implement componentDidUpdate to handle their changes, and componentWillUnmount to clean up whatever componentDidMount was doing.
For example, this ChatRoom component keeps a chat connection synchronized with props and state:
Note that in development when Strict Mode is on, React will call componentDidMount, immediately call componentWillUnmount, and then call componentDidMount again. This helps you notice if you forgot to implement componentWillUnmount or if its logic doesn’t fully “mirror” what componentDidMount does.
We recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. See how to migrate.
By default, if your application throws an error during rendering, React will remove its UI from the screen. To prevent this, you can wrap a part of your UI into an error boundary. An error boundary is a special component that lets you display some fallback UI instead of the part that crashed—for example, an error message.
To implement an error boundary component, you need to provide static getDerivedStateFromError which lets you update state in response to an error and display an error message to the user. You can also optionally implement componentDidCatch to add some extra logic, for example, to log the error to an analytics service.
Then you can wrap a part of your component tree with it:
If Profile or its child component throws an error, ErrorBoundary will “catch” that error, display a fallback UI with the error message you’ve provided, and send a production error report to your error reporting service.
You don’t need to wrap every component into a separate error boundary. When you think about the granularity of error boundaries, consider where it makes sense to display an error message. For example, in a messaging app, it makes sense to place an error boundary around the list of conversations. It also makes sense to place one around every individual message. However, it wouldn’t make sense to place a boundary around every avatar.
There is currently no way to write an error boundary as a function component. However, you don’t have to write the error boundary class yourself. For example, you can use react-error-boundary instead.
Typically, you will define components as functions instead.
For example, suppose you’re converting this Greeting class component to a function:
Define a function called Greeting. This is where you will move the body of your render function.
Instead of this.props.name, define the name prop using the destructuring syntax and read it directly:
Here is a complete example:
Suppose you’re converting this Counter class component to a function:
Start by declaring a function with the necessary state variables:
Next, convert the event handlers:
Finally, replace all references starting with this with the variables and functions you defined in your component. For example, replace this.state.age with age, and replace this.handleNameChange with handleNameChange.
Here is a fully converted component:
Suppose you’re converting this ChatRoom class component with lifecycle methods to a function:
First, verify that your componentWillUnmount does the opposite of componentDidMount. In the above example, that’s true: it disconnects the connection that componentDidMount sets up. If such logic is missing, add it first.
Next, verify that your componentDidUpdate method handles changes to any props and state you’re using in componentDidMount. In the above example, componentDidMount calls setupConnection which reads this.state.serverUrl and this.props.roomId. This is why componentDidUpdate checks whether this.state.serverUrl and this.props.roomId have changed, and resets the connection if they did. If your componentDidUpdate logic is missing or doesn’t handle changes to all relevant props and state, fix that first.
In the above example, the logic inside the lifecycle methods connects the component to a system outside of React (a chat server). To connect a component to an external system, describe this logic as a single Effect:
This useEffect call is equivalent to the logic in the lifecycle methods above. If your lifecycle methods do multiple unrelated things, split them into multiple independent Effects. Here is a complete example you can play with:
If your component does not synchronize with any external systems, you might not need an Effect.
In this example, the Panel and Button class components read context from this.context:
When you convert them to function components, replace this.context with useContext calls:

```
class Greeting extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
```


```
import { Component } from 'react';

# What is a React element, exactly?

createElement lets you create a React element. It serves as an alternative to writing JSX.

Usage
Creating an element without JSX
Creating an element without JSX
Call createElement to create a React element with the given type, props, and children.
See more examples below.
type: The type argument must be a valid React component type. For example, it could be a tag name string (such as 'div' or 'span'), or a React component (a function, a class, or a special component like Fragment).
type: The type argument must be a valid React component type. For example, it could be a tag name string (such as 'div' or 'span'), or a React component (a function, a class, or a special component like Fragment).
props: The props argument must either be an object or null. If you pass null, it will be treated the same as an empty object. React will create an element with props matching the props you have passed. Note that ref and key from your props object are special and will not be available as element.props.ref and element.props.key on the returned element. They will be available as element.ref and element.key.
props: The props argument must either be an object or null. If you pass null, it will be treated the same as an empty object. React will create an element with props matching the props you have passed. Note that ref and key from your props object are special and will not be available as element.props.ref and element.props.key on the returned element. They will be available as element.ref and element.key.
optional ...children: Zero or more child nodes. They can be any React nodes, including React elements, strings, numbers, portals, empty nodes (null, undefined, true, and false), and arrays of React nodes.
optional ...children: Zero or more child nodes. They can be any React nodes, including React elements, strings, numbers, portals, empty nodes (null, undefined, true, and false), and arrays of React nodes.
createElement returns a React element object with a few properties:
type: The type you have passed.
props: The props you have passed except for ref and key. If the type is a component with legacy type.defaultProps, then any missing or undefined props will get the values from type.defaultProps.
ref: The ref you have passed. If missing, null.
key: The key you have passed, coerced to a string. If missing, null.
Usually, you’ll return the element from your component or make it a child of another element. Although you may read the element’s properties, it’s best to treat every element as opaque after it’s created, and only render it.
You must treat React elements and their props as immutable and never change their contents after creation. In development, React will freeze the returned element and its props property shallowly to enforce this.

When you use JSX, you must start a tag with a capital letter to render your own custom component. In other words, <Something /> is equivalent to createElement(Something), but <something /> (lowercase) is equivalent to createElement('something') (note it’s a string, so it will be treated as a built-in HTML tag).

You should only pass children as multiple arguments to createElement if they are all statically known, like createElement('h1', {}, child1, child2, child3). If your children are dynamic, pass the entire array as the third argument: createElement('ul', {}, listItems). This ensures that React will warn you about missing keys for any dynamic lists. For static lists this is not necessary because they never reorder.

If you don’t like JSX or can’t use it in your project, you can use createElement as an alternative.
To create an element without JSX, call createElement with some type, props, and children:
The children are optional, and you can pass as many as you need (the example above has three children). This code will display a <h1> header with a greeting. For comparison, here is the same example rewritten with JSX:
To render your own React component, pass a function like Greeting as the type instead of a string like 'h1':
With JSX, it would look like this:
Here is a complete example written with createElement:
And here is the same example written using JSX:
Both coding styles are fine, so you can use whichever one you prefer for your project. The main benefit of using JSX compared to createElement is that it’s easy to see which closing tag corresponds to which opening tag.





```
const element = createElement(type, props, ...children)
```


```
import { createElement } from 'react';

function Greeting({ name }) {
  return createElement(
    'h1',
    { className: 'greeting' },
    'Hello'
  );
}
```


```
import { createElement } from 'react';

function Greeting({ name }) {
  return createElement(
    'h1',
    { className: 'greeting' },
    'Hello ',
    createElement('i', null, name),
    '. Welcome!'
  );
}
```


```
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return (
    <h1 className=""greeting"">
      Hello <i>{name}</i>. Welcome!
    </h1>
  );
}
```


```
export default function App() {
  return createElement(Greeting, { name: 'Taylor' });
}
```


```
export default function App() {
  return <Greeting name=""Taylor"" />;
}

Call createFactory(type) to create a factory function which produces React elements of a given type.
Then you can use it to create React elements without JSX:
See more examples below.
type: The type argument must be a valid React component type. For example, it could be a tag name string (such as 'div' or 'span'), or a React component (a function, a class, or a special component like Fragment).
Returns a factory function. That factory function receives a props object as the first argument, followed by a list of ...children arguments, and returns a React element with the given type, props and children.
Although most React projects use JSX to describe the user interface, JSX is not required. In the past, createFactory used to be one of the ways you could describe the user interface without JSX.
Call createFactory to create a factory function for a specific element type like 'button':
Calling that factory function will produce React elements with the props and children you have provided:
This is how createFactory was used as an alternative to JSX. However, createFactory is deprecated, and you should not call createFactory in any new code. See how to migrate away from createFactory below.
If your project has many createFactory calls, copy this createFactory.js implementation into your project:
This lets you keep all of your code unchanged except the imports.
If you have a few createFactory calls that you don’t mind porting manually, and you don’t want to use JSX, you can replace every call a factory function with a createElement call. For example, you can replace this code:
with this code:
Here is a complete example of using React without JSX:
Finally, you can use JSX instead of createFactory. This is the most common way to use React:
Sometimes, your existing code might pass some variable as a type instead of a constant like 'button':
To do the same in JSX, you need to rename your variable to start with an uppercase letter like Type:
Otherwise React will interpret <type> as a built-in HTML tag because it is lowercase.

```
const factory = createFactory(type)
```


```
import { createFactory } from 'react';

const button = createFactory('button');
```


```
export default function App() {
  return button({
    onClick: () => {
      alert('Clicked!')
    }
  }, 'Click me');
}

    }
  }, 'Click me');
}
```


```
import { createElement } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  return createElement('button', {
    onClick: () => {
      alert('Clicked!')
    }
  }, 'Click me');
}
```

createRef creates a ref object which can contain arbitrary value.

Migrating from a class with createRef to a function with useRef
Call createRef to declare a ref inside a class component.
See more examples below.
createRef takes no parameters.
createRef returns an object with a single property:
current: Initially, it’s set to the null. You can later set it to something else. If you pass the ref object to React as a ref attribute to a JSX node, React will set its current property.
createRef always returns a different object. It’s equivalent to writing { current: null } yourself.
In a function component, you probably want useRef instead which always returns the same object.
const ref = useRef() is equivalent to const [ref, _] = useState(() => createRef(null)).
To declare a ref inside a class component, call createRef and assign its result to a class field:
If you now pass ref={this.inputRef} to an <input> in your JSX, React will populate this.inputRef.current with the input DOM node. For example, here is how you make a button that focuses the input:

We recommend using function components instead of class components in new code. If you have some existing class components using createRef, here is how you can convert them. This is the original code:
When you convert this component from a class to a function, replace calls to createRef with calls to useRef:

```
class MyInput extends Component {
  inputRef = createRef();

import { createRef, Component } from 'react';

class MyComponent extends Component {

Usage
Checking if something is a React element
Checking if something is a React element
Call isValidElement(value) to check whether value is a React element.
See more examples below.
value: The value you want to check. It can be any a value of any type.
isValidElement returns true if the value is a React element. Otherwise, it returns false.
Only JSX tags and objects returned by createElement are considered to be React elements. For example, even though a number like 42 is a valid React node (and can be returned from a component), it is not a valid React element. Arrays and portals created with createPortal are also not considered to be React elements.
Call isValidElement to check if some value is a React element.
React elements are:
Values produced by writing a JSX tag
Values produced by calling createElement
For React elements, isValidElement returns true:
Any other values, such as strings, numbers, or arbitrary objects and arrays, are not React elements.
For them, isValidElement returns false:
It is very uncommon to need isValidElement. It’s mostly useful if you’re calling another API that only accepts elements (like cloneElement does) and you want to avoid an error when your argument is not a React element.
Unless you have some very specific reason to add an isValidElement check, you probably don’t need it.











```
const isElement = isValidElement(value)
```


```
import { isValidElement, createElement } from 'react';

// ✅ React elements
console.log(isValidElement(<p />)); // true
console.log(isValidElement(createElement('p'))); // true

// ❌ Not React elements
console.log(isValidElement(25)); // false
console.log(isValidElement('Hello')); // false
console.log(isValidElement({ age: 42 })); // false

```
import { isValidElement, createElement } from 'react';

Alternatives
Migrating from a PureComponent class component to a function
Migrating from a PureComponent class component to a function
To skip re-rendering a class component for same props and state, extend PureComponent instead of Component:
PureComponent is a subclass of Component and supports all the Component APIs. Extending PureComponent is equivalent to defining a custom shouldComponentUpdate method that shallowly compares props and state.
See more examples below.
React normally re-renders a component whenever its parent re-renders. As an optimization, you can create a component that React will not re-render when its parent re-renders so long as its new props and state are the same as the old props and state. Class components can opt into this behavior by extending PureComponent:
A React component should always have pure rendering logic. This means that it must return the same output if its props, state, and context haven’t changed. By using PureComponent, you are telling React that your component complies with this requirement, so React doesn’t need to re-render as long as its props and state haven’t changed. However, your component will still re-render if a context that it’s using changes.
In this example, notice that the Greeting component re-renders whenever name is changed (because that’s one of its props), but not when address is changed (because it’s not passed to Greeting as a prop):
We recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. See how to migrate.
We recommend using function components instead of class components in new code. If you have some existing class components using PureComponent, here is how you can convert them. This is the original code:
When you convert this component from a class to a function, wrap it in memo:
Unlike PureComponent, memo does not compare the new and the old state. In function components, calling the set function with the same state already prevents re-renders by default, even without memo.

```
class Greeting extends PureComponent {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
```


```
import { PureComponent } from 'react';

class Greeting extends PureComponent {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
```


```
class Greeting extends PureComponent {
  render() {

# Introduction to React

Videos dedicated to the discussion of React and the React ecosystem.
In the keynote, we shared our vision for the future of React starting with React 18.
Watch the full keynote from Andrew Clark, Juan Tejada, Lauren Tan, and Rick Hanlon here:
For a demo of upgrading to React 18, see Shruti Kapoor’s talk here:
React 18 also includes improvements to server-side rendering performance using Suspense.
Streaming server rendering lets you generate HTML from React components on the server, and stream that HTML to your users. In React 18, you can use Suspense to break down your app into smaller independent units which can be streamed independently of each other without blocking the rest of the app. This means users will see your content sooner and be able to start interacting with it much faster.
For a deep dive, see Shaundai Person’s talk here:
For React 18, we created our first Working Group to collaborate with a panel of experts, developers, library maintainers, and educators. Together we worked to create our gradual adoption strategy and refine new APIs such as useId, useSyncExternalStore, and useInsertionEffect.
For an overview of this work, see Aakansha’ Doshi’s talk:
To support the new features in this release, we also announced the newly formed React DevTools team and a new Timeline Profiler to help developers debug their React apps.
For more information and a demo of new DevTools features, see Brian Vaughn’s talk:
Looking further into the future, Xuan Huang (黄玄) shared an update from our React Labs research into an auto-memoizing compiler. Check out this talk for more information and a demo of the compiler prototype:
Rachel Nabors kicked off a section of talks about learning and designing with React with a keynote about our investment in React’s new docs (now shipped as react.dev):
We also heard talks on learning and designing with React:
Debbie O’Brien: Things I learnt from the new React docs.
Sarah Rainsberger: Learning in the Browser.
Linton Ye: The ROI of Designing with React.
Delba de Oliveira: Interactive playgrounds with React.
Talks from the Relay, React Native, and PyTorch teams:
Robert Balicki: Re-introducing Relay.
Eric Rozell and Steven Moyes: React Native Desktop.
Roman Rädle: On-device Machine Learning for React Native
And talks from the community on accessibility, tooling, and Server Components:
Daishi Kato: React 18 for External Store Libraries.
Diego Haz: Building Accessible Components in React 18.
Tafu Nakazaki: Accessible Japanese Form Components with React.
Lyle Troxell: UI tools for artists.
Helen Lin: Hydrogen + React 18.

# Past contributors

React development is led by a dedicated team working full time at Meta. It also receives contributions from people all over the world.
The React Core team members work full time on the core component APIs, the engine that powers React DOM and React Native, React DevTools, and the React documentation website.
Current members of the React team are listed in alphabetical order below.
Andrew got started with web development by making sites with WordPress, and eventually tricked himself into doing JavaScript. His favorite pastime is karaoke. Andrew is either a Disney villain or a Disney princess, depending on the day.
Dan got into programming after he accidentally discovered Visual Basic inside Microsoft PowerPoint. He has found his true calling in turning Sebastian’s tweets into long-form blog posts. Dan occasionally wins at Fortnite by hiding in a bush until the game ends.
Eli got into programming after he got suspended from middle school for hacking. He has been working on React and React Native since 2017. He enjoys eating treats, especially ice cream and apple pie. You can find Eli trying quirky activities like parkour, indoor skydiving, and aerial silks.
Shortly after being introduced to AutoHotkey, Jack had written scripts to automate everything he could think of. When reaching limitations there, he dove headfirst into web app development and hasn’t looked back. Most recently, Jack worked on the web platform at Instagram before moving to React. His favorite programming language is JSX.
Jason abandoned embedded C for a career in front-end engineering and never looked back. Armed with esoteric CSS knowledge and a passion for beautiful UI, Jason joined Facebook in 2010, where he now feels privileged to have seen JavaScript development come of age. Though he may not understand how for...of loops work, he loves getting to work with brilliant people on projects that enable amazing UX.
Joe was planning to major in math and philosophy but got into computer science after writing physics simulations in Matlab. Prior to React, he worked on Relay, RSocket.js, and the Skip programming language. While he’s not building some sort of reactive system he enjoys running, studying Japanese, and spending time with his family.
Josh majored in Mathematics and discovered programming while in college. His first professional developer job was to program insurance rate calculations in Microsoft Excel, the paragon of Reactive Programming which must be why he now works on React. In between that time Josh has been an IC, Manager, and Executive at a few startups. outside of work he likes to push his limits with cooking.
Lauren’s programming career peaked when she first discovered the <marquee> tag. She’s been chasing that high ever since. She studied Finance instead of CS in college, so she learned to code using Excel instead of Java. Lauren enjoys dropping cheeky memes in chat, playing video games with her partner, and petting her dog Zelda.
Luna first learnt the fundamentals of python at the age of 6 from her father. Since then, she has been unstoppable. Luna aspires to be a gen z, and the road to success is paved with environmental advocacy, urban gardening and lots of quality time with her Voo-Doo’d (as pictured).
Matt stumbled into coding, and since then, has become enamored with creating things in communities that can’t be created alone. Prior to React, he worked on YouTube, the Google Assistant, Fuchsia, and Google Cloud AI and Evernote. When he’s not trying to make better developer tools he enjoys the mountains, jazz, and spending time with his family.
Mofei started programming when she realized it can help her cheat in video games. She focused on operating systems in undergrad / grad school, but now finds herself happily tinkering on React. Outside of work, she enjoys debugging bouldering problems and planning her next backpacking trip(s).
Noah’s interest in UI programming sparked during his education in music technology at NYU. At Meta, he’s worked on internal tools, browsers, web performance, and is currently focused on React. Outside of work, Noah can be found tinkering with synthesizers or spending time with his cat.
Ricky majored in theoretical math and somehow found himself on the React Native team for a couple years before joining the React team. When he’s not programming you can find him snowboarding, biking, climbing, golfing, or closing GitHub issues that do not match the issue template.
Ruslan’s introduction to UI programming started when he was a kid by manually editing HTML templates for his custom gaming forums. Somehow, he ended up majoring in Computer Science. He enjoys music, games, and memes. Mostly memes.
Sathya hated the Dragon Book in school but somehow ended up working on compilers all his career. When he’s not compiling React components, he’s either drinking coffee or eating yet another Dosa.
Sebastian majored in psychology. He’s usually quiet. Even when he says something, it often doesn’t make sense to the rest of us until a few months later. The correct way to pronounce his surname is “mark-boa-geh” but he settled for “mark-beige” out of pragmatism — and that’s how he approaches React.
Sebastian learned programming to make the browser games he played during class more enjoyable. Eventually this lead to contributing to as much open source code as possible. Outside of coding he’s busy making sure people don’t confuse him with the other Sebastians and Zilberman of the React community.
Seth started programming as a kid growing up in Tucson, AZ. After school, he was bitten by the music bug and was a touring musician for about 10 years before returning to work, starting with Intuit. In his spare time, he loves taking pictures and flying for animal rescues in the northeastern United States.
Four days after React was released, Sophie rewrote the entirety of her then-current project to use it, which she now realizes was perhaps a bit reckless. After she became the project’s #1 committer, she wondered why she wasn’t getting paid by Facebook like everyone else was and joined the team officially to lead React through its adolescent years. Though she quit that job years ago, somehow she’s still in the team’s group chats and “providing value”.
Tianyu’s interest in computers started as a kid because he loves video games. So he majored in computer science and still plays childish games like League of Legends. When he is not in front of a computer, he enjoys playing with his two kittens, hiking and kayaking.
Yuzhi studied Computer Science in school. She liked the instant gratification of seeing code come to life without having to physically be in a laboratory. Now she’s a manager in the React org. Before management, she used to work on the Relay data fetching framework. In her spare time, Yuzhi enjoys optimizing her life via gardening and home improvement projects.

All stable builds of React go through a high level of testing and follow semantic versioning (semver). React also offers unstable release channels to encourage early feedback on experimental features. This page describes what you can expect from React releases.
For a list of previous releases, see the Versions page.
Stable React releases (also known as “Latest” release channel) follow semantic versioning (semver) principles.
That means that with a version number x.y.z:
When releasing critical bug fixes, we make a patch release by changing the z number (ex: 15.6.2 to 15.6.3).
When releasing new features or non-critical fixes, we make a minor release by changing the y number (ex: 15.6.2 to 15.7.0).
When releasing breaking changes, we make a major release by changing the x number (ex: 15.6.2 to 16.0.0).
Major releases can also contain new features, and any release can include bug fixes.
Minor releases are the most common type of release.
Breaking changes are inconvenient for everyone, so we try to minimize the number of major releases – for example, React 15 was released in April 2016 and React 16 was released in September 2017, and React 17 was released in October 2020.
Instead, we release new features in minor versions. That means that minor releases are often more interesting and compelling than majors, despite their unassuming name.
As we change React over time, we try to minimize the effort required to take advantage of new features. When possible, we’ll keep an older API working, even if that means putting it in a separate package. For example, mixins have been discouraged for years but they’re supported to this day via create-react-class and many codebases continue to use them in stable, legacy code.
Over a million developers use React, collectively maintaining millions of components. The Facebook codebase alone has over 50,000 React components. That means we need to make it as easy as possible to upgrade to new versions of React; if we make large changes without a migration path, people will be stuck on old versions. We test these upgrade paths on Facebook itself – if our team of less than 10 people can update 50,000+ components alone, we hope the upgrade will be manageable for anyone using React. In many cases, we write automated scripts to upgrade component syntax, which we then include in the open-source release for everyone to use.
Development builds of React include many helpful warnings. Whenever possible, we add warnings in preparation for future breaking changes. That way, if your app has no warnings on the latest release, it will be compatible with the next major release. This allows you to upgrade your apps one component at a time.
Development warnings won’t affect the runtime behavior of your app. That way, you can feel confident that your app will behave the same way between the development and production builds — the only differences are that the production build won’t log the warnings and that it is more efficient. (If you ever notice otherwise, please file an issue.)
In general, we don’t bump the major version number for changes to:
Development warnings. Since these don’t affect production behavior, we may add new warnings or modify existing warnings in between major versions. In fact, this is what allows us to reliably warn about upcoming breaking changes.
APIs starting with unstable_. These are provided as experimental features whose APIs we are not yet confident in. By releasing these with an unstable_ prefix, we can iterate faster and get to a stable API sooner.
Alpha and Canary versions of React. We provide alpha versions of React as a way to test new features early, but we need the flexibility to make changes based on what we learn in the alpha period. If you use these versions, note that APIs may change before the stable release.
Undocumented APIs and internal data structures. If you access internal property names like __SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED or __reactInternalInstance$uk43rzhitjg, there is no warranty. You are on your own.
This policy is designed to be pragmatic: certainly, we don’t want to cause headaches for you. If we bumped the major version for all of these changes, we would end up releasing more major versions and ultimately causing more versioning pain for the community. It would also mean that we can’t make progress in improving React as fast as we’d like.
That said, if we expect that a change on this list will cause broad problems in the community, we will still do our best to provide a gradual migration path.
It’s possible that a minor release will not include new features. This is allowed by semver, which states “[a minor version] MAY be incremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced within the private code. It MAY include patch level changes.”
However, it does raise the question of why these releases aren’t versioned as patches instead.
The answer is that any change to React (or other software) carries some risk of breaking in unexpected ways. Imagine a scenario where a patch release that fixes one bug accidentally introduces a different bug. This would not only be disruptive to developers, but also harm their confidence in future patch releases. It’s especially regrettable if the original fix is for a bug that is rarely encountered in practice.
We have a pretty good track record for keeping React releases free of bugs, but patch releases have an even higher bar for reliability because most developers assume they can be adopted without adverse consequences.
For these reasons, we reserve patch releases only for the most critical bugs and security vulnerabilities.
If a release includes non-essential changes — such as internal refactors, changes to implementation details, performance improvements, or minor bugfixes — we will bump the minor version even when there are no new features.
React relies on a thriving open source community to file bug reports, open pull requests, and submit RFCs. To encourage feedback we sometimes share special builds of React that include unreleased features.
This section will be most relevant to developers who work on frameworks, libraries, or developer tooling. Developers who use React primarily to build user-facing applications should not need to worry about our prerelease channels.
Each of React’s release channels is designed for a distinct use case:
Latest is for stable, semver React releases. It’s what you get when you install React from npm. This is the channel you’re already using today. User-facing applications that consume React directly use this channel.
Canary tracks the main branch of the React source code repository. Think of these as release candidates for the next semver release. Frameworks or other curated setups may choose to use this channel with a pinned version of React. You can also use Canaries for integration testing between React and third party projects.
Experimental includes experimental APIs and features that aren’t available in the stable releases. These also track the main branch, but with additional feature flags turned on. Use this to try out upcoming features before they are released.
All releases are published to npm, but only Latest uses semantic versioning. Prereleases (those in the Canary and Experimental channels) have versions generated from a hash of their contents and the commit date, e.g. 18.3.0-canary-388686f29-20230503 for Canary and 0.0.0-experimental-388686f29-20230503 for Experimental.
Both Latest and Canary channels are officially supported for user-facing applications, but with different expectations:
Latest releases follow the traditional semver model.
Canary releases must be pinned and may include breaking changes. They exist for curated setups (like frameworks) that want to gradually release new React features and bugfixes on their own release schedule.
The Experimental releases are provided for testing purposes only, and we provide no guarantees that behavior won’t change between releases. They do not follow the semver protocol that we use for releases from Latest.
By publishing prereleases to the same registry that we use for stable releases, we are able to take advantage of the many tools that support the npm workflow, like unpkg and CodeSandbox.
Latest is the channel used for stable React releases. It corresponds to the latest tag on npm. It is the recommended channel for all React apps that are shipped to real users.
If you’re not sure which channel you should use, it’s Latest. If you’re using React directly, this is what you’re already using. You can expect updates to Latest to be extremely stable. Versions follow the semantic versioning scheme, as described earlier.
The Canary channel is a prerelease channel that tracks the main branch of the React repository. We use prereleases in the Canary channel as release candidates for the Latest channel. You can think of Canary as a superset of Latest that is updated more frequently.
The degree of change between the most recent Canary release and the most recent Latest release is approximately the same as you would find between two minor semver releases. However, the Canary channel does not conform to semantic versioning. You should expect occasional breaking changes between successive releases in the Canary channel.
Do not use prereleases in user-facing applications directly unless you’re following the Canary workflow.
Releases in Canary are published with the canary tag on npm. Versions are generated from a hash of the build’s contents and the commit date, e.g. 18.3.0-canary-388686f29-20230503.
The Canary channel also supports integration testing between React and other projects.
All changes to React go through extensive internal testing before they are released to the public. However, there are a myriad of environments and configurations used throughout the React ecosystem, and it’s not possible for us to test against every single one.
If you’re the author of a third party React framework, library, developer tool, or similar infrastructure-type project, you can help us keep React stable for your users and the entire React community by periodically running your test suite against the most recent changes. If you’re interested, follow these steps:
Set up a cron job using your preferred continuous integration platform. Cron jobs are supported by both CircleCI and Travis CI.
Set up a cron job using your preferred continuous integration platform. Cron jobs are supported by both CircleCI and Travis CI.
In the cron job, update your React packages to the most recent React release in the Canary channel, using canary tag on npm. Using the npm cli:
npm update react@canary react-dom@canary
Or yarn:
yarn upgrade react@canary react-dom@canary
In the cron job, update your React packages to the most recent React release in the Canary channel, using canary tag on npm. Using the npm cli:
Or yarn:
Run your test suite against the updated packages.
Run your test suite against the updated packages.
If everything passes, great! You can expect that your project will work with the next minor React release.
If everything passes, great! You can expect that your project will work with the next minor React release.
If something breaks unexpectedly, please let us know by filing an issue.

A project that uses this workflow is Next.js. You can refer to their CircleCI configuration as an example.
Like Canary, the Experimental channel is a prerelease channel that tracks the main branch of the React repository. Unlike Canary, Experimental releases include additional features and APIs that are not ready for wider release.
Usually, an update to Canary is accompanied by a corresponding update to Experimental. They are based on the same source revision, but are built using a different set of feature flags.
Experimental releases may be significantly different than releases to Canary and Latest. Do not use Experimental releases in user-facing applications. You should expect frequent breaking changes between releases in the Experimental channel.
Releases in Experimental are published with the experimental tag on npm. Versions are generated from a hash of the build’s contents and the commit date, e.g. 0.0.0-experimental-68053d940-20210623.
Experimental features are ones that are not ready to be released to the wider public, and may change drastically before they are finalized. Some experiments may never be finalized — the reason we have experiments is to test the viability of proposed changes.
For example, if the Experimental channel had existed when we announced Hooks, we would have released Hooks to the Experimental channel weeks before they were available in Latest.
You may find it valuable to run integration tests against Experimental. This is up to you. However, be advised that Experimental is even less stable than Canary. We do not guarantee any stability between Experimental releases.
Experimental features may or may not be documented. Usually, experiments aren’t documented until they are close to shipping in Canary or Latest.
If a feature is not documented, they may be accompanied by an RFC.
We will post to the React blog when we’re ready to announce new experiments, but that doesn’t mean we will publicize every experiment.
You can always refer to our public GitHub repository’s history for a comprehensive list of changes.
